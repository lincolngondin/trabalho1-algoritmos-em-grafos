Highly segmented calorimeters represent a modern trend in experimental particle physics aimed at improving the energy resolution with the particle flow reconstruction. The widely used and cost-effective solution is the structure assembled from small scintillator elements readout by tiny photosensors. The improvement of signal to noise ratio can be achieved by operating at low temperatures. The paper presents studies of temperature dependence of response to muons for elements comprised of plastic scintillator tiles with different options of reflective coverage and read out by silicon photomultipliers. No temperature dependence of response for bare tiles has been detected. With reflective film, the reduction of response with decreasing temperature is observed. The measured effect amounts to 10% in the range from +30oC to -30oC.
