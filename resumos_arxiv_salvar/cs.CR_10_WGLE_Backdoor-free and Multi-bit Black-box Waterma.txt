Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly deployed in graph-related applications, making ownership verification critical to protect their intellectual property against model theft. Fingerprinting and black-box watermarking are two main methods. However, the former relies on determining model similarity, which is computationally expensive and prone to ownership collisions after model post-processing such as model pruning or fine-tuning. The latter embeds backdoors, exposing watermarked models to the risk of backdoor attacks. Moreover, both methods enable ownership verification but do not convey additional information. As a result, each distributed model requires a unique trigger graph, and all trigger graphs must be used to query the suspect model during verification. Multiple queries increase the financial cost and the risk of detection.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes WGLE, a novel black-box watermarking paradigm for GNNs that enables embedding the multi-bit string as the ownership information without using backdoors. WGLE builds on a key insight we term Layer-wise Distance Difference on an Edge (LDDE), which quantifies the difference between the feature distance and the prediction distance of two connected nodes. By predefining positive or negative LDDE values for multiple selected edges, WGLE embeds the watermark encoding the intended information without introducing incorrect mappings that compromise the primary task. WGLE is evaluated on six public datasets and six mainstream GNN architectures along with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that WGLE achieves 100% ownership verification accuracy, an average fidelity degradation of 0.85%, comparable robustness against potential attacks, and low embedding overhead. The code is available in the repository.
