Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite mega-constellations have recently emerged as a viable access solution for broadband services in underserved areas. In 2024, Direct Satellite-to-Device (DS2D) communications, which enable unmodified smartphones to connect directly to spaceborne base stations, entered large-scale beta testing, with Starlink globally leading deployments. This paper presents the first measurement study of commercial DS2D services. Using crowdsourced mobile network data collected in the U.S. between October 2024 and April 2025, our research derives evidence-based insights into the capabilities, limitations, and prospective evolution of DS2D technologies providing Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) services to expand existing mobile network connectivity. We observe a strong correlation between the number of satellites deployed and the expanding extension of observed measurements, concentrated in accessible but poorly covered areas by terrestrial networks, such as national parks and large low-density counties. The data reveal stable physical-layer value measurement throughout the observation period, with a lower median RSRP (24-dB difference) and a higher RSRQ (3 dB difference) compared to terrestrial networks, reflecting the SMS-only usage of the DS2D network during this period. Based on SINR measurements, we estimate the expected performance of the announced DS2D mobile data service to be around 4 Mbps per beam in outdoor conditions. We also discuss strategies to expand this capacity up to 12 Mbps in the future, depending on key regulatory decisions regarding satellite licenses, spectrum availability, and allowable radiated power levels.
