An embedding $\phi:V \rightarrow S^n$ of a compact, connected manifold $V$ into the unit sphere $S^n \subset {\bf R}^{n+1}$ is said to be taut, if every nondegenerate spherical distance function $d_p$, $p \in S^n$, is a perfect Morse function on $V$, i.e., it has the minimum number of critical points on $V$ required by the Morse inequalities. In these notes, we give an exposition of the proof of the invariance of tautness under Lie sphere transformations due to √Ålvarez Paiva. First we extend the definition of tautness of submanifolds of $S^n$ to the concept of Lie-tautness of Legendre submanifolds of the contact manifold $\Lambda^{2n-1}$ of projective lines on the Lie quadric $Q^{n+1}$. This definition has the property that if $\phi:V \rightarrow S^n$ is an embedding of a compact, connected manifold $V$, then $\phi(V)$ is a taut submanifold in $S^n$ if and only if the Legendre lift $\lambda$ of $\phi$ is Lie-taut. Furthermore, Lie-tautness is invariant under the action of Lie sphere transformations on Legendre submanifolds. As a consequence, we get that if $\phi:V \rightarrow S^n$ and $\psi:V \rightarrow S^n$ are two embeddings of a compact, connected manifold $V$ into $S^n$, such that their corresponding Legendre lifts are related by a Lie sphere transformation, then $\phi$ is a taut embedding if and only if $\psi$ is a taut embedding. Thus, in that sense, tautness is invariant under Lie sphere transformations. The key idea is to formulate tautness in terms of real-valued functions on $S^n$ whose level sets form a parabolic pencil of unoriented spheres in $S^n$, and then show that this is equivalent to the usual formulation of tautness in terms of spherical distance functions, whose level sets in $S^n$ form a pencil of unoriented concentric spheres.
