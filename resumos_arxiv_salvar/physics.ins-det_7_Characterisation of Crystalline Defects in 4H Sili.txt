Future hadron collider experiments will require sensing materials that withstand stronger radiation fields. Therefore, either a frequent replacement of detectors, a significant increase in radiation hardness of Silicon, or a shift to different materials is needed. Wide-bandgap materials are a natural choice, due to their significantly reduced leakage currents, even after irradiation. In recent years, substantial progress in the production of high-quality monocrystalline Silicon Carbide of the 4H polytype has led to a renewed interest in this material. In this article, a study of electrically active defects in a n-type epitaxial 4H Silicon Carbide diode is presented. By employing spectroscopical measurement methods, like Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) and Thermally Stimulated Currents (TSC), energy levels in the bandgap are investigated. Defect parameters like concentration, activation energy and capture cross-section are stated. A simulation framework was utilised to compare and match the results from the two methods. This study is made in the context of a study of radiation hardness of 4H Silicon Carbide sensors. Other studies investigating macroscopic properties of the material, like their charge collection efficiency after irradiation, were performed on the same kind of diodes. This study provides a first set of measured defect parameters in state-of-the-art 4H-SiC material, from defects present prior to irradiation. These defects are intrinsic, such as vacancies, related to impurities and doping imperfections, or are growth related. The $Z_\text{1/2}$ defect and a Nitrogen related defect were identified.
