Sonification can be part of educational resources that can be accessible to those who prefer, or require, non-visual learning methods. Furthermore, sonification can contribute to an engaging multi-sensory learning experience, which are known to benefit general learners. Whilst some sonification can be relatively agnostic to musical culture, many sonifications are subject to culturally influenced choices, such as the chosen harmonies, rhythmic structures, and instrumentation. This is important when considering how universally inclusive and relatable sonification-based educational resources will be. Here we present a case study of translating a sonification-based educational show about the Solar System, that was originally designed with influences from Euro-American (Western-classical) music, to be more culturally relevant to the Caribbean region. We describe the motivation, approach, some of the challenges, and the initial feedback of the resulting output of the project. Finally, we provide reflections on the importance of further work exploring how educational sonifications can transcend international borders and musical cultures.
