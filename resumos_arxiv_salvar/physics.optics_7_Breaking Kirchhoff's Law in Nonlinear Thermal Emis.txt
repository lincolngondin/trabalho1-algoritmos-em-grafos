Thermal radiation is strictly governed by Kirchhoff s law to reach thermal equilibrium. The violation of Kirchhoff s law decouples nonreciprocally the equity between absorptivity and emissivity, enabling exotic thermal engineering applications. However, achieving broadband nonreciprocal thermal emissivity and absorptivity remains a challenge. Here we experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal and broadband thermal radiation by breaking Kirchhoff s law through nonlinear optical frequency conversion in a scattering medium. Thermal blackbody radiation is upconverted through sum-frequency generation with an intense infrared pump, while broadband conversion is enabled by the critical random quasi-phase-matching condition in the nonlinear nanocrystals. Moreover, a temporal transient measurement also indicates a possible active radiation cooling through such nonlinear thermal radiation. These results may pave a new way for nonlinear and active thermal management in critical applications like radiation cooling, energy harvesting, and infrared camouflage.
