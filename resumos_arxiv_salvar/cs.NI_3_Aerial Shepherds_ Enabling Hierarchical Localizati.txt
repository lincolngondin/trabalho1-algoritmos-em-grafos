A heterogeneous micro aerial vehicles (MAV) swarm consists of resource-intensive but expensive advanced MAVs (AMAVs) and resource-limited but cost-effective basic MAVs (BMAVs), offering opportunities in diverse fields. Accurate and real-time localization is crucial for MAV swarms, but current practices lack a low-cost, high-precision, and real-time solution, especially for lightweight BMAVs. We find an opportunity to accomplish the task by transforming AMAVs into mobile localization infrastructures for BMAVs. However, translating this insight into a practical system is challenging due to issues in estimating locations with diverse and unknown localization errors of BMAVs, and allocating resources of AMAVs considering interconnected influential factors. This work introduces TransformLoc, a new framework that transforms AMAVs into mobile localization infrastructures, specifically designed for low-cost and resource-constrained BMAVs. We design an error-aware joint location estimation model to perform intermittent joint estimation for BMAVs and introduce a similarity-instructed adaptive grouping-scheduling strategy to allocate resources of AMAVs dynamically. TransformLoc achieves a collaborative, adaptive, and cost-effective localization system suitable for large-scale heterogeneous MAV swarms. We implement and validate TransformLoc on industrial drones. Results show it outperforms all baselines by up to 68\% in localization performance, improving navigation success rates by 60\%. Extensive robustness and ablation experiments further highlight the superiority of its design.
