We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the Implied Volatility in the Bachelier setting, extending the framework introduced by Benaim and Friz for the Black-Scholes setting. Exploiting the theory of regular variation, we derive explicit expressions for the Bachelier Implied Volatility in the wings of the smile, linking these to the tail behaviour of the underlying's returns' distribution. Furthermore, we establish a direct connection between the analyticity strip of the returns' characteristic function and the asymptotic formula for the Implied Volatility smile at extreme moneyness.
