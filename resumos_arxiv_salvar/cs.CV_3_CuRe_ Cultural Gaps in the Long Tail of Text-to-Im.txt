Popular text-to-image (T2I) systems are trained on web-scraped data, which is heavily Amero and Euro-centric, underrepresenting the cultures of the Global South. To analyze these biases, we introduce CuRe, a novel and scalable benchmarking and scoring suite for cultural representativeness that leverages the marginal utility of attribute specification to T2I systems as a proxy for human judgments. Our CuRe benchmark dataset has a novel categorical hierarchy built from the crowdsourced Wikimedia knowledge graph, with 300 cultural artifacts across 32 cultural subcategories grouped into six broad cultural axes (food, art, fashion, architecture, celebrations, and people). Our dataset's categorical hierarchy enables CuRe scorers to evaluate T2I systems by analyzing their response to increasing the informativeness of text conditioning, enabling fine-grained cultural comparisons. We empirically observe much stronger correlations of our class of scorers to human judgments of perceptual similarity, image-text alignment, and cultural diversity across image encoders (SigLIP 2, AIMV2 and DINOv2), vision-language models (OpenCLIP, SigLIP 2, Gemini 2.0 Flash) and state-of-the-art text-to-image systems, including three variants of Stable Diffusion (1.5, XL, 3.5 Large), FLUX.1 [dev], Ideogram 2.0, and DALL-E 3.
