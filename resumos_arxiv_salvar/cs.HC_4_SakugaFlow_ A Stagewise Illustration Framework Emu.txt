While current AI illustration tools can generate high-quality images from text prompts, they rarely reveal the step-by-step procedure that human artists follow. We present SakugaFlow, a four-stage pipeline that pairs diffusion-based image generation with a large-language-model tutor. At each stage, novices receive real-time feedback on anatomy, perspective, and composition, revise any step non-linearly, and branch alternative versions. By exposing intermediate outputs and embedding pedagogical dialogue, SakugaFlow turns a black-box generator into a scaffolded learning environment that supports both creative exploration and skills acquisition.
