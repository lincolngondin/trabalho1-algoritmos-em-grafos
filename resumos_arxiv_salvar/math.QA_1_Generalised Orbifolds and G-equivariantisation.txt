In a construction motivated by topological field theory, a so-called orbifold datum $\mathbb{A}$ in a ribbon category $C$ allows one to define a new ribbon category $C_{\mathbb{A}}$. If $C$ is the neutral component of a $G$-crossed ribbon category $B$, and $\mathbb{A}$ is an orbifold datum in $C$ defined in terms of $B$, one finds that $C_{\mathbb{A}}$ is equivalent to the equivariantisation $B^G$ of $B$ as a ribbon category. We give a constructive proof of this equivalence.
