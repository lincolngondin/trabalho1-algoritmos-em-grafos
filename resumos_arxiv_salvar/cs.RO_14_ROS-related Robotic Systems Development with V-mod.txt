As robotic systems grow increasingly complex, heterogeneous, and safety-critical, the need for structured development methodologies becomes paramount. Although frameworks like the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) offer foundational tools, they often lack integration when used together. This paper addresses that gap by aligning the widely recognized V-model development paradigm with the MeROS metamodel SysML-based modeling language tailored for ROS-based systems.
We propose a domain-specific methodology that bridges ROS-centric modelling with systems engineering practices. Our approach formalises the structure, behaviour, and validation processes of robotic systems using MeROS, while extending it with a generalized, adaptable V-model compatible with both ROS and ROS 2. Rather than prescribing a fixed procedure, the approach supports project-specific flexibility and reuse, offering guidance across all stages of development.
The approach is validated through a comprehensive case study on HeROS, a heterogeneous multi-robot platform comprising manipulators, mobile units, and dynamic test environments. This example illustrates how the MeROS-compatible V-model enhances traceability and system consistency while remaining accessible and extensible for future adaptation. The work contributes a structured, tool-agnostic foundation for developers and researchers seeking to apply MBSE practices in ROS-based projects.
