We present new polynomial-based methods for discrete-time quaternionic systems, highlighting how noncommutative multiplication modifies classical control approaches. Defining quaternionic polynomials via a backward-shift operator, we examine left and right fraction representations of transfer functions, showing that right zeros correspond to similarity classes of quaternionic matrix right eigenvalues. We then propose a feedback design procedure that generalizes pole placement to quaternions - a first approach using a genuine quaternionic polynomial equation.
