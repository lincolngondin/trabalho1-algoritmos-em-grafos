We study mean-field Ising models whose coupling depends on the magnetization via a feedback function. We identify mixed phases (MPs) and show that they can be stable at zero temperature for sufficiently strong feedback. Moreover, stable MPs are always super-stable with perturbation decaying linearly in time. We argue that such feedback Ising models (FIMs) provide a useful framework for phase transformations between aligned phases via stable and unstable intermediate phases in multistable systems. We also analyze the dynamical behavior of FIMs driven by a time-varying magnetic field.
