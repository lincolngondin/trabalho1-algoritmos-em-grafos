This paper considers a mathematical model of steady flows of an inviscid and incompressible fluid moving in the azimuthal direction. The water density varies with depth and the waves are propagating under the force of gravity, over a flat bed and with a free surface, on which acts a force of surface tension. Our solution pertains to large scale equatorial dynamics of a fluid with free surface expressed in cylindrical coordinates. We also prove a regularity result for the free surface.
