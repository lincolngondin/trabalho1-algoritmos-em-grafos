This paper deals with the derivation of compressible two-phase flow models. We use a thin domain approximation of a two-layer configuration governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, following the works [H. B. Stewart and B. Wendroff, J. Comp. Phys., 56 (1984)] and [V. H. Ransom and D. L. Hicks, J. Comput. Phys., 75 (1988)]. In order to recover source terms and two-velocity models directly from this asymptotic analysis, we remove the continuity of the tangential component of the velocity at the interface, and properly scale friction and viscosity coefficients. We are then able to derive two-velocity one-pressure models, first in the barotropic case and then in the full Navier-Stokes-Fourier case.
