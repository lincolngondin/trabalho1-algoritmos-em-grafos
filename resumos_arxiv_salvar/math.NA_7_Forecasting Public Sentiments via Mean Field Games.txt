A mathematical model for forecasting of public sentiments via the Mean Field Games theory is proposed. A numerical method is developed. This is a version of the so-called convexification method. Convergence analysis demonstrates the global convergence of this method. Convergence rate is established. Numerical experiments demonstrate both an accurate performance of the convexification technique and some promising features of this approach.
