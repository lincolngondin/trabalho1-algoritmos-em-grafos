In this work, we examine fundamental elements of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as well as how to tune them. Concretely, we focus on two different foundational neuronal units utilized in SNNs -- the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) and the resonate-and-fire (RAF) neuron. We explore key equations and how hyperparameter values affect behavior. Beyond hyperparameters, we discuss other important design elements of SNNs -- the choice of input encoding and the setup for excitatory-inhibitory populations -- and how these impact LIF and RAF dynamics.
