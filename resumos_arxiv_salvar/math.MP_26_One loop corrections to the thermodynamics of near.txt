We compute one-loop corrections to the euclidean gravitational path integral of near-extremal (anti-)de Sitter-Kerr black hole in terms of the connection coefficients of the Heun equation describing the black hole linear perturbations in the Teukolsky formalism. We show that different near-extremal limits lead to distinct physical properties of the gravitational configuration, as they get described by distinct limiting differential equations. As a result, the light modes emerging in the limit determine different scaling properties in the temperature of the one-loop determinants. We show that the cold case displays distinctive universal log(T) corrections to the entropy of the system, including the ultracold regime. On the contrary, these do not appear in the limit in which the event horizon superimposes onto the cosmological one. In the Schwarzschild-de Sitter case, a further check is performed by comparison with the Denef-Hartnoll-Sachdev formula.
