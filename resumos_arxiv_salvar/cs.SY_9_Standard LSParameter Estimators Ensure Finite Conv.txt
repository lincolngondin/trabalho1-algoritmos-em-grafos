In this brief note we recall the little-known fact that, for linear regression equations (LRE) with intervally excited (IE) regressors, standard Least Square (LS) parameter estimators ensure finite convergence time (FCT) of the estimated parameters. The convergence time being equal to the time length needed to comply with the IE assumption. As is well-known, IE is necessary and sufficient for the identifiability of the LRE-hence, it is the weakest assumption for the on-or off-line solution of the parameter estimation problem.
