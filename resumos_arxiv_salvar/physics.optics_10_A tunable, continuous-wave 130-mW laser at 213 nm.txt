We present a tunable, continuous-wave (CW) laser system emitting at 213 nm, based on the frequency quadrupling of a single Ti:sapph laser. The setup features two sequential, cavity-enhanced second-harmonic generation (SHG) stages. The first stage uses an LBO crystal and achieves a conversion efficiency of over 80%, yielding up to 3.3 W at 426 nm. The second stage employs a Brewster-cut BBO crystal with an elliptical beam waist to mitigate UV-induced degradation, producing up to 130 mW of deep UV light. The system demonstrates stable operation over several hours and is well suited for applications in atomic physics, spectroscopy, and materials science.
