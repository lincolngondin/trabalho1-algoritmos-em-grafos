This paper focuses on the multi-target tracking using the Stone Soup framework. In particular, we aim at evaluation of two multi-target tracking scenarios based on the simulated class-B dataset and ADS-B class-A dataset provided by OpenSky Network. The scenarios are evaluated w.r.t. selection of a local state estimator using a range of the Stone Soup metrics. Source code with scenario definitions and Stone Soup set-up are provided along with the paper.
