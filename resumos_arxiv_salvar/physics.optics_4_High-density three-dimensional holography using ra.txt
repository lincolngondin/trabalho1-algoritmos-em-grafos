One of the most common methods for reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) images of real objects is digital holography. This technique relies on the use of electro-optical devices that modify the phase or amplitude of light fields in a controlled manner, the so-called spatial light modulators. However, given that holography typically requires coherent light sources, a common problem with three-dimensional projection is the crosstalk between the layers that make up the 3D object. This limits full-depth control and directly affects image quality. Interestingly, in the past few years, several methods have proven to be effective in breaking layer crosstalk by erasing the spatial coherence of light. A drawback of such solutions is that, in many cases, additional optical resources are required to achieve such a task. In this work, we present a method for high-density reconstruction of three-dimensional objects using rapid modulation of light fields by means of digital micromirror devices (DMDs). The 3D reconstruction is performed by discretizing the object into multiplane light-point contours, where the resolution of the contours is controlled by the density of the light points. This allows us to achieve point separations, in the transverse plane, as small as 100 $\mu$m. The high refresh rate of the DMD ($\sim 10$ kHz) allows for a reconstruction where each point of the 3D image is spatially and temporally controlled by independent amplitude holograms, thus effectively eliminating coherence-induced multiplane crosstalk without the need for additional optical elements. Because of its simplicity and versatility, we believe that our method provides a practical route toward compact, high-resolution 3D holographic projectors.
