When shooting electronic screens, moiré patterns usually appear in captured images, which seriously affects the image quality. Existing image demoiréing methods face great challenges in removing large and heavy moiré. To address the issue, we propose to utilize Dual Camera fusion for Image Demoiréing (DCID), \ie, using the ultra-wide-angle (UW) image to assist the moiré removal of wide-angle (W) image. This is inspired by two motivations: (1) the two lenses are commonly equipped with modern smartphones, (2) the UW image generally can provide normal colors and textures when moiré exists in the W image mainly due to their different focal lengths. In particular, we propose an efficient DCID method, where a lightweight UW image encoder is integrated into an existing demoiréing network and a fast two-stage image alignment manner is present. Moreover, we construct a large-scale real-world dataset with diverse mobile phones and monitors, containing about 9,000 samples. Experiments on the dataset show our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset are available at this https URL.
