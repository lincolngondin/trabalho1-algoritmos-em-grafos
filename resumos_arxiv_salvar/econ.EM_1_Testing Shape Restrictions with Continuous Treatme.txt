We propose tests for the convexity/linearity/concavity of a transformation of the dependent variable in a semiparametric transformation model. These tests can be used to verify monotonicity of the treatment effect, or, equivalently, concavity/convexity of the outcome with respect to the treatment, in (quasi-)experimental settings. Our procedure does not require estimation of the transformation or the distribution of the error terms, thus it is easy to implement. The statistic takes the form of a U statistic or a localised U statistic, and we show that critical values can be obtained by bootstrapping. In our application we test the convexity of loan demand with respect to the interest rate using experimental data from South Africa.
