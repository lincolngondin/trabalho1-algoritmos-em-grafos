We address some fundamental problems concerning the structure of idealistic equivalence relations. In particular, we show that, under analytic determinacy, there are continuum many idealistic analytic equivalence relations that are not classwise Borel isomorphic to an orbit equivalence relation. Moreover, we also discuss alternative formulations of the E1 conjecture, and present an elementary counterexample to one of its earliest variants proposed by Hjorth and Kechris in 1997.
