Numerous methods have been proposed to generate physical adversarial patches (PAPs) against real-world machine learning systems. However, each existing PAP typically supports only a single, fixed attack goal, and switching to a different objective requires re-generating and re-deploying a new PAP. This rigidity limits their practicality in dynamic environments like autonomous driving, where traffic conditions and attack goals can change rapidly. For example, if no obstacles are present around the target vehicle, the attack may fail to cause meaningful consequences.
To overcome this limitation, we propose SwitchPatch, a novel PAP that is static yet enables dynamic and controllable attack outcomes based on real-time scenarios. Attackers can alter pre-defined conditions, e.g., by projecting different natural-color lights onto SwitchPatch to seamlessly switch between attack goals. Unlike prior work, SwitchPatch does not require re-generation or re-deployment for different objectives, significantly reducing cost and complexity. Furthermore, SwitchPatch remains benign when the enabling conditions are absent, enhancing its stealth.
We evaluate SwitchPatch on two key tasks: traffic sign recognition (classification and detection) and depth estimation. First, we conduct theoretical analysis and empirical studies to demonstrate the feasibility of SwitchPatch and explore how many goals it can support using techniques like color light projection and occlusion. Second, we perform simulation-based experiments and ablation studies to verify its effectiveness and transferability. Third, we conduct outdoor tests using a Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to confirm its robustness in the physical world. Overall, SwitchPatch introduces a flexible and practical adversarial strategy that can be adapted to diverse tasks and real-world conditions.
