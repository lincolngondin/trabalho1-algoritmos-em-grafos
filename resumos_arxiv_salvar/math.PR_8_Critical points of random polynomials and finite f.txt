A result of Hoskins and Steinerberger [Int. Math. Res. Not., (13):9784-9809, 2022] states that repeatedly differentiating a random polynomials with independent and identically distributed mean zero and variance one roots will result, after an appropriate rescaling, in a Hermite polynomial. We use the theory of finite free probability to extend this result in two natural directions: (1) We prove central limit theorems for the fluctuations around these deterministic limits for the polynomials and their roots. (2) We consider a generalized version of the Hoskins and Steinerberger result by removing the finite second moment assumption from the roots. In this case the Hermite polynomials are replaced by a random Appell sequence conveniently described through finite free probability and an infinitely divisible distribution. We use finite free cumulants to provide compact proofs of our main results with little prerequisite knowledge of free probability required.
