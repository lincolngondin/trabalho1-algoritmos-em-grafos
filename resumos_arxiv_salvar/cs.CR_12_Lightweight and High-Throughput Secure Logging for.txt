The growing deployment of resource-limited Internet of Things (IoT) devices and their expanding attack surfaces demand efficient and scalable security mechanisms. System logs are vital for the trust and auditability of IoT, and offloading their maintenance to a Cold Storage-as-a-Service (Cold-STaaS) enhances cost-effectiveness and reliability. However, existing cryptographic logging solutions either burden low-end IoT devices with heavy computation or create verification delays and storage inefficiencies at Cold-STaaS. There is a pressing need for cryptographic primitives that balance security, performance, and scalability across IoT-Cold-STaaS continuum.
In this work, we present Parallel Optimal Signatures for Secure Logging (POSLO), a novel digital signature framework that, to our knowledge, is the first to offer constant-size signatures and public keys, near-optimal signing efficiency, and tunable fine-to-coarse-grained verification for log auditing. POSLO achieves these properties through efficient randomness management, flexible aggregation, and multiple algorithmic instantiations. It also introduces a GPU-accelerated batch verification framework that exploits homomorphic signature aggregation to deliver ultra-fast performance. For example, POSLO can verify 231 log entries per second on a mid-range consumer GPU (NVIDIA GTX 3060) while being significantly more compact than state-of-the-art. POSLO also preserves signer-side efficiency, offering substantial battery savings for IoT devices, and is well-suited for the IoT-Cold-STaaS ecosystem.
