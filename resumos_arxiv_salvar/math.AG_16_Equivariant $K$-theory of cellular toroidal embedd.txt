In this article we describe the
$G_{comp}\times G_{comp}$-equivariant topological $K$-ring of a {\em
cellular} toroidal embedding $\mathbb{X}$ of a complex connected
reductive algebraic group $G$. In particular, our results extend the
results in \cite{u1} and \cite{u2} on the regular embeddings of $G$,
to the equivariant topological $K$-ring of a larger class of
(possibly singular) cellular toroidal embeddings. They are also a
topological analogue of the results in \cite{gon} on the operational
equivariant algebraic $K$-ring, for cellular toroidal
embeddings.
