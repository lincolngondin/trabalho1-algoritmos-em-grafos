We characterize the behavior of stochastic Navier-Stokes on $\mathbb{T} \times [-1,1]$ with Navier boundary conditions at high Reynolds number when initialized near Couette flow subject to small additive stochastic forcing. We take additive noise of strength $\nu^{1/2+} \Phi dV_t + \nu^{2/3+\alpha} \Psi dW_t$, where $\Phi dV_t$ has spatial correlation in $H_0^3$ and acts only on $x$-independent modes of the vorticity, while $\Psi dW_t$ has spatial correlation in a lower order, anisotropic, Sobolev space $\mathcal{H}$ and acts on $x$-dependent-modes. We take the initial $x$-independent modes in the perturbation to be small in $H_0^3$ in a $\nu$-independent sense, while the non-zero $x$-modes are taken to be $O(\nu^{1/2 + \alpha})$ in $\mathcal{H}$. Letting $\omega$ solve the resulting perturbation equation, we split $\omega$ into the zero $x$-modes $\omega_0$ and the non-zero $x$-modes $\omega_{\neq}$. We demonstrate an averaging principle holds wherein $\omega_{\neq}$ is the fast variable and $\omega_0$ is the slow variable, deriving a closed nonlinear evolution equation on $\omega_0$ that holds over long time-scales (while the fast $\omega_{\neq}$ modes solve a `pseudo-linearized' equation to leading order with dynamics dominated by inviscid damping and enhanced dissipation). This work can also be considered the stochastic analogue of the stability threshold problem for shear flows.
