Electromechanical switching devices such as relays, solenoid valves, and contactors offer several technical and economic advantages that make them widely used in industry. However, uncontrolled operations result in undesirable impact-related phenomena at the end of the stroke. As a solution, different soft-landing controls have been proposed. Among them, feedforward control with iterative techniques that adapt its parameters is a solution when real-time feedback is not available. However, these techniques typically require a large number of operations to converge or are computationally intensive, which limits a real implementation. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for the iterative adaptation that is able to eventually adapt the search coordinate system and to reduce the search dimensional size in order to accelerate convergence. Moreover, it automatically toggles between a derivative-free and a gradient-based method to balance exploration and exploitation. To demonstrate the high potential of the proposal, each novel part of the algorithm is compared with a state-of-the-art approach via simulation.
