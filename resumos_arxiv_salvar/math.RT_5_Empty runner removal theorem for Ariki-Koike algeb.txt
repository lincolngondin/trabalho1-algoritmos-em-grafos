For the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of type $A$, James and Mathas proved a theorem which relates $v$-decomposition numbers for different values of $e$, by adding empty runners to the James' abacus display. This result is often referred to as the empty runner removal theorem. In this paper, we extend this theorem to the Ariki-Koike algebras, establishing a similar relationship for the $v$-decomposition numbers.
