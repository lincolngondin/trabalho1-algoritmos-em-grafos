Motivated by the relative differential geometry, where the Euclidean normal vector of hypersurfaces is generalized by a relative normalization, we introduce anisotropic area measures of convex bodies, constructed with respect to a gauge body. Together with the anisotropic curvature measures, they are special cases of the newly introduced anisotropic support measures. We show that a convex body in ${\mathbb R}^n$, for which the anisotropic area measure of some order $k\in\{0,\dots,n-2\}$ is proportional to the area measure of order $n-1$, must be a $k$-tangential body of the gauge body.
