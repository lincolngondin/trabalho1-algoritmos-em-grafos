This paper proposes an innovative technique for representing multidimensional datasets using icons inspired by Chernoff faces. Our approach combines classical projection techniques with the explicit assignment of selected data dimensions to avatar (facial) features, leveraging the innate human ability to interpret facial traits. We introduce a semantic division of data dimensions into intuitive and technical categories, assigning the former to avatar features and projecting the latter into a four-dimensional (or higher) spatial embedding. The technique is implemented as a plugin for the open-source dpVision visualization platform, enabling users to interactively explore data in the form of a swarm of avatars whose spatial positions and visual features jointly encode various aspects of the dataset. Experimental results with synthetic test data and a 12-dimensional dataset of Portuguese Vinho Verde wines demonstrate that the proposed method enhances interpretability and facilitates the analysis of complex data structures.
