We consider the seriation problem, where the statistician seeks to recover a hidden ordering from a noisy observation of a permuted Robinson matrix. We tightly characterize the minimax rate of this problem on a general class of matrices which satisfy some local assumptions, and we provide a polynomial time algorithm achieving this rate. Our general results cover the special case of bi-Lipschitz matrices, thereby answering two open questions of [Giraud et al., 2021]. Our analysis further extends to broader classes of matrices.
