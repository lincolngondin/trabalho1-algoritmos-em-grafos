Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative technology for electromagnetic (EM) wave manipulation, offering unprecedented control over wave reflections compared to traditional metallic reflectors. By utilizing an array of tunable elements, RIS can steer and shape electromagnetic waves to enhance signal quality in wireless communication and radar systems. However, practical implementations face significant challenges due to hardware limitations and phase quantization errors. In this work, a 1-bit RIS prototype operating at 28 GHz is developed to experimentally evaluate the impact of hardware constraints on RIS performance. Unlike conventional studies that model RIS as an ideal phase-shift matrix, this study accounts for physical parameters that influence the actual reflection pattern. In particular, the presence of specular reflection due to hardware limitations is investigated. Additionally, the effects of phase quantization errors, which stem from the discrete nature of RIS elements, are analyzed, and a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization is introduced to mitigate these errors. The proposed optimization strategy effectively reduces gain degradation at the desired angle caused by 1-bit quantization, enhancing the overall performance of RIS. The effectiveness of the approach is validated through measurements, underscoring the importance of advanced phase control techniques in improving the functionality of RIS.
