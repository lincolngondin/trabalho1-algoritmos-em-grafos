At present, all textual backdoor attack methods are based on single triggers: for example, inserting specific content into the text to activate the backdoor; or changing the abstract text features. The former is easier to be identified by existing defense strategies due to its obvious characteristics; the latter, although improved in invisibility, has certain shortcomings in terms of attack performance, construction of poisoned datasets, and selection of the final poisoning rate. On this basis, this paper innovatively proposes a Dual-Trigger backdoor attack based on syntax and mood, and optimizes the construction of the poisoned dataset and the selection strategy of the final poisoning rate. A large number of experimental results show that this method significantly outperforms the previous methods based on abstract features in attack performance, and achieves comparable attack performance (almost 100% attack success rate) with the insertion-based method. In addition, the two trigger mechanisms included in this method can be activated independently in the application phase of the model, which not only improves the flexibility of the trigger style, but also enhances its robustness against defense strategies. These results profoundly reveal that textual backdoor attacks are extremely harmful and provide a new perspective for security protection in this field.
