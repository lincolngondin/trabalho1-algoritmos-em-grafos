Neural disorders refer to any condition affecting the nervous system and that influence how individuals perceive and interact with the world. Traditional neural diagnoses rely on cumbersome, time-consuming, or subjective methods, such as clinical interviews, behavioural observations, or medical imaging. Eye tracking is an attractive alternative because analysing eye movements, such as fixations and saccades, can provide more objective insights into brain function and cognitive processing by capturing non-verbal and unconscious responses. Despite its potential, existing gaze-based studies presented seemingly contradictory findings. They are dispersed across diverse fields, requiring further research to standardise protocols and expand their application, particularly as a preliminary indicator of neural processes for differential diagnosis. Therefore, this paper outlines the main agreed-upon findings and provides a systematisation of knowledge and key guidelines towards advancing gaze-based neural preliminary diagnosis.
