The detection and localization of a source hidden outside the Line-of-Sight (LOS) traditionally rely on the acquisition of indirect signals, such as those reflected from visible relay surfaces such as floors or walls. These reflected signals are then utilized to reconstruct the obscured scene. In this study, we present an approach that utilize signals diffracted from an edge of an obstacle to achieve three-dimensional (3D) localization of an acoustic point source situated outside the LOS. We address two scenarios - a doorway and a convex corner - and propose a localization method for each of them. For the first scenario, we utilize the two edges of the door as virtual detector arrays. For the second scenario, we exploit the spectral signature of a knife-edge diffraction, inspired by the human perception of sound location by the head-related transfer function (HRTF). In both methods, knife-edge diffraction is utilized to extend the capabilities of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) acoustic sensing, enabling localization in environments where conventional relay-surface based approaches may be limited.
