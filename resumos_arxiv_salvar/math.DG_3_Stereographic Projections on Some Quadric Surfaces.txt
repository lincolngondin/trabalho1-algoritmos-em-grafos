In this work, we present an adaptation of the classical stereographic projection, originally formulated for the sphere, now considering the context of the ellipsoid and the elliptic paraboloid. We begin by constructing the stereographic projections for both quadric surfaces separately, analyzing the geometric particularities of each surface and the challenges arising from their variable curvatures and, in the case of the paraboloid, its non-compactness. In the final part of the work, we establish results concerning the eccentricities, curvatures, arc length, and areas of the ellipses formed by the intersection of the quadrics with horizontal sections and their corresponding projections onto the plane-xy.
