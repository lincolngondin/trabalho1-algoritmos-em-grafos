Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for manual optimization.
