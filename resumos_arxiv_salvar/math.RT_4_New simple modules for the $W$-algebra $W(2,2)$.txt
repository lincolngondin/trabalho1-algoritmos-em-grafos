In this paper, we construct a novel class of simple modules for the $W$-algebra $W(2,2)$. Our approach involves taking tensor products of finitely many non-weight simple modules $\Omega(\lambda,\alpha,h)$ with an arbitrary simple restricted module. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for these modules to be simple, and subsequently determine their isomorphism classes. Through a comparative analysis with other known simple modules in the literature, we establish that these constructed modules are generically new.
