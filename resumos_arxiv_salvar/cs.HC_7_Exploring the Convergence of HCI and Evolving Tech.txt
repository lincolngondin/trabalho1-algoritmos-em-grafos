Modern technology driven information systems are part of our daily lives. However, this deep integration poses new challenges to the human computer interaction (HCI) professionals. With the rapid growth of mobile and cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), the demand for HCI specialists to design user-friendly and adaptable interfaces has never been more pressing. Especially for diverse user groups such as children, the elderly and people with disabilities who need interfaces tailored to their needs regardless of time and location. This study reviewed 50 recent papers on HCI interface design for modern information systems. The goal is to see how well these methods address the demands of current technology. The findings show that most HCI design methods are still based on old desktop models and do not support mobile users and location-based services well. Most existing interface design guidelines do not align with the flexibility and dynamism of emerging technologies. The goal of this study is to improve interface design by combining agile methodologies with human-centered design principles. Future studies should also incorporate both qualitative and quantitative approaches, particularly in the context of cloud-based technologies and organizational information systems. This approach aims to bridge the gap between current interface design practices and the changing technological landscape.
