This work presents a novel course titled The World of AI designed for first-year undergraduate engineering students with little to no prior exposure to AI. The central problem addressed by this course is that engineering students often lack foundational knowledge of AI and its broader societal implications at the outset of their academic journeys. We believe the way to address this gap is to design and deliver an interdisciplinary course that can a) be accessed by first-year undergraduate engineering students across any domain, b) enable them to understand the basic workings of AI systems sans mathematics, and c) make them appreciate AI's far-reaching implications on our lives. The course was divided into three modules co-delivered by faculty from both engineering and humanities. The planetary module explored AI's dual role as both a catalyst for sustainability and a contributor to environmental challenges. The societal impact module focused on AI biases and concerns around privacy and fairness. Lastly, the workplace module highlighted AI-driven job displacement, emphasizing the importance of adaptation. The novelty of this course lies in its interdisciplinary curriculum design and pedagogical approach, which combines technical instruction with societal discourse. Results revealed that students' comprehension of AI challenges improved across diverse metrics like (a) increased awareness of AI's environmental impact, and (b) efficient corrective solutions for AI fairness. Furthermore, it also indicated the evolution in students' perception of AI's transformative impact on our lives.
