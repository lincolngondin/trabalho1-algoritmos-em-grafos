We consider the embedding of integrable Teichmüller spaces $T_p$ into analytic Besov spaces by using pre-Schwarzian derivatives. Unlike the case of the Bers embedding by Schwarzian derivatives, there is a big difference between the cases $p>1$ and $p=1$. In this paper, we focus on the case $p=1$ and generalize the previous results obtained for $p>1$. This gives a unified approach to the complex analytic theory of integrable Teichmüller spaces $T_p$ for all $p \geq 1$.
