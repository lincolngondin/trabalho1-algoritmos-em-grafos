This volume contains the papers presented at the 23rd International Overture Workshop, held on the 11th of June 2025. This event was the latest in a series of workshops around the Vienna Development Method (VDM), the open-source project Overture, and related tools and formalisms. VDM is one of the longest established formal methods for systems development. A lively community of researchers and practitioners has grown up in academia and industry has grown around the modelling languages (VDM-SL, VDM++, VDM-RT, CML) and tools (VDMTools, Overture, Crescendo, Symphony, the INTO-CPS chain, and ViennaTalk). Together, these provide a platform for work on modelling and analysis technology that includes static and dynamic analysis, test generation, execution support, and model checking. This workshop provided updates on the emerging technology of VDM/Overture, including collaboration infrastructure, collaborative modelling and co-simulation for Cyber-Physical Systems.
