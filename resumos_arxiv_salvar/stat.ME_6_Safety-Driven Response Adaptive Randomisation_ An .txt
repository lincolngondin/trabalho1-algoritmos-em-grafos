The majority of response-adaptive randomisation (RAR) designs in the literature use efficacy data to dynamically allocate patients. Their applicability in settings where the efficacy measure is observable with a random delay, such as overall survival, remains challenging. This paper introduces a RAR design referred to as SAFER (Safety-Aware Flexible Elastic Randomisation) design, which uses early-emerging safety data to inform treatment allocation decisions in oncology trials. However, the design is applicable to a range of settings where it may be desirable to favour the arm demonstrating a superior safety profile. This is particularly relevant in non-inferiority trials, which aim to demonstrate an experimental treatment is not inferior to the standard of care, while offering advantages in terms of safety and tolerability. Consequently, an unavoidable and well-established trade-off arises for such designs: to balance the goals of preserving inferential efficiency for the primary non-inferiority outcome while incorporating safety considerations into the randomisation process through RAR. Our method, defines a randomisation procedure which prioritises the assignment of patients to better-tolerated arms and adjusts the allocation proportion according to the observed association between safety and efficacy endpoints. We illustrate our procedure through a comprehensive simulation study, inspired by the CAPP-IT Phase III oncology trial. Our results demonstrate that SAFER preserves statistical power even when efficacy and safety endpoints are weakly associated and offers power gains when a strong positive association is present. Moreover, the approach enables a faster/slower adaptation when efficacy and safety endpoints are temporally aligned/misaligned, respectively.
