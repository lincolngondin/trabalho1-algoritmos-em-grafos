Experiments of isochoric heating by protons of solid material were recently performed at LULI laser facilities. In these experiments, protons, produced from target normal sheath acceleration (TNSA) of Au foil with the PICO2000 laser, deposit their energy into an aluminum or copper foil initially at room temperature and solid density. The heated material reaches the warm dense matter regime with temperature in the rear face of the material between 1 and 5 eV. The temperature is inferred by streaked optical pyrometry and the proton beam is characterized by Thomson parabola. The high-energy protons produced by TNSA are modeled to deduce the initial proton distribution before the slowing down in the target. Hydrodynamic radiative simulations were next performed using the TROLL code in multidimensional geometry. In the TROLL code, the heating of protons is modeled with a Monte-Carlo transport module of charged particle and the calculation of the energy deposited by the protons in the matter is performed using stopping power formulas like SRIM functions. The results of simulations with the TROLL code are compared with the experimental results. An acceptable agreement between experiment and simulation is found for the temperature at the rear of the material using SESAME equation of state and SRIM stopping power for protons in aluminum.
