Bipartite calculus is a direct generalization of Kauffman planar expansion from $N=2$ to arbitrary $N$, applicable to the restricted class of knots which are entirely made of antiparallel lock tangles. Whenever applicable, it allows a straightforward generalization of the Khovanov calculus without a need of the technically complicated matrix factorization used for arbitrary $N$ in the Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) approach. The main object here is the $3^{n}$-dimensional hypercube with $n$ being the number of bipartite vertices. Maps, differentials, complex and Poincar√© polynomials are straightforward and indeed reproduce the Khovanov-Rozansky polynomials in the known cases. This provides a great simplification of the Khovanov-Rozansky calculus on the bipartite locus, what can make it an accessible tool for the study of superpolynomials.
