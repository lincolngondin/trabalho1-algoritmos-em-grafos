A matching of graph $G$ is maximal if it cannot be expanded by adding any edge to create a larger matching. In this paper, for a hexagonal ring $H$ with $n$ hexagons, we show that the number of maximal matchings of $H$ equals to the trace of the product of $n$ matrices, each of which is $S$, $L$, or $R$ according to the type of the connection mode of $H$. Finally, we extend this conclusion to arbitrary polygon rings and provide an algorithm to determine the transition matrices of polygon chains (rings).
