We've developed a scalable and sustainable online atomic data portal with an automated interface for easy update and addition of new data. The current portal provides energies, transition matrix elements, transition rates, radiative lifetimes, branching ratios, polarizabilities, hyperfine constants, and other data, for 28 atoms and ions. It also features an interactive polarizability plotting interface for neutral atoms and singly-charged ions. The data production is supported by recent developments of open-access atomic software based on our research codes, including new workflow algorithms, which allow large volumes of such data to be generated with automated accuracy assessments. This entails a new method of comparing our calculated values with data from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database. All calculated values include estimated uncertainties. Data for more systems will be added in the future. Experimental values are included with references, where high-precision data are available.
