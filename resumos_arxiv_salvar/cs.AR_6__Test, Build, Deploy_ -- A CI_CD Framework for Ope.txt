Addressing TedX, Amber Huffman made an impassioned case that "none of us is as smart as all of us" and that open-source hardware is the future. A major contribution to software quality, open source and otherwise, on the software side, is the systems design methodology of Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD), which we propose to systematically bring to hardware designs and their specifications. To do so, we automatically generate specifications using specification mining, "a machine learning approach to discovering formal specifications" which dramatically impacted the ability of software engineers to achieve quality, verification, and security. Yet applying the same techniques to hardware is non-trivial. We present a technique for generalized, continuous integration (CI) of hardware specification designs that continually deploys (CD) a hardware specification. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate Myrtha, a cloud-based, specification generator based on established hardware and software quality tools.
