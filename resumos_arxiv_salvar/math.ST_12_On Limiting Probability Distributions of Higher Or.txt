The limiting (or stationary) probability distribution is one of the key characteristics of a Markov chain since it shows its long-term behavior. In this paper, for a higher order Markov chain, we establish a sufficient condition for the existence of its limiting probability distribution. This condition is built upon the regularity of its transition tensor. Our results extend the corresponding conclusions for first order chains. Besides, they complement the existing results concerning higher order chains that rely on approximation schemes or two-phase power iterations.
