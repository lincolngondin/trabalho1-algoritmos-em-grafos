This study investigates the applicability of the semi-implicit particle-in-cell code FLEKS to collisionless shock simulations, with a focus on the parameter regime relevant to global magnetosphere modeling. We examine one- and two-dimensional local planar shock simulations, initialized using MHD states with upstream conditions representative of the solar wind at 1 au, for both quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel configurations. The refined algorithm in FLEKS proves robust, enabling accurate shock simulations with a grid resolution on the order of the electron inertial length $d_e$. Our simulations successfully capture key shock features, including shock structures (foot, ramp, overshoot, and undershoot), upstream and downstream waves (fast magnetosonic, whistler, Alfv√©n ion-cyclotron, and mirror modes), and non-Maxwellian particle distributions. Crucially, we find that at least two spatial dimensions are critical for accurately reproducing downstream wave physics in quasi-perpendicular shocks and capturing the complex dynamics of quasi-parallel shocks, including surface rippling, shocklets, SLAMS, and jets. Furthermore, our parameter studies demonstrate the impact of mass ratio and grid resolution on shock physics. This work provides valuable guidance for selecting appropriate physical and numerical parameters for a semi-implicit PIC code, paving the way for incorporating kinetic shock processes into large-scale space plasma simulations with the MHD-AEPIC model.
