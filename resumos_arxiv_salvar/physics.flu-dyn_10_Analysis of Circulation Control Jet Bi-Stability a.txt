The phenomenon of a periodic jet detachment occurring on an elliptic airfoil utilizing circulation control at transonic speeds was evaluated using numerical simulations. As the momentum of the jet increases beyond a prescribed magnitude, the jet begins to detach periodically from the surface of the trailing-edge. The effect was analyzed by both URANS calculations as well as by data-driven methods such as the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). The results of the investigation showed that the effect, termed jet-buffet, is decoupled from the dominant shockwave located upstream, indicating that the jet can no longer augment the wing's circulation, and thus the termination of circulation control. Furthermore, it was found that the governing mechanism of the bi-stability originated from a feedback of pressure propagating between the trailing-edge shockwave and the downstream separation bubble produced by the jet, as well as a secondary feedback governing the pressure redistribution due to the detachment cycle. It was concluded that the bi-stability can not only be captured by URANS effectively but also approximated using a Reduced Order Model via 2% of the total modes, which encapsulate 25% of the modal influence as well as reconstructing the pressure field with 98% accuracy.
