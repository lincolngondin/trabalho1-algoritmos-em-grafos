The Grassmannian, which is the manifold of all $k$-dimensional subspaces in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, was decomposed through three equivalent methods connecting combinatorial geometries, Schubert cells and convex polyhedra by Gelfand, Goresky, MacPherson and Serganova. Recently, Liang, Wang and Zhao discovered a novel decomposition of the Grassmannian via an essential hyperplane arrangement, which generalizes the first two methods. However, their work was confined to essential hyperplane arrangements. Motivated by their research, we extend their results to a general hyperplane arrangement $\mathcal{A}$, and demonstrate that the $\mathcal{A}$-matroid, the $\mathcal{A}$-adjoint and the refined $\mathcal{A}$-Schubert decompositions of the Grassmannian are consistent. As a byproduct, we provide a classification for $k$-restrictions of $\mathcal{A}$ related to all $k$-subspaces through two equivalent methods: the $\mathcal{A}$-matroid decomposition and the $\mathcal{A}$-adjoint decomposition.
