In this paper, we presented a study of topological indices on trees, where we show a relationship with irregularity of Albertson index and minimum, maximum degrees $\delta,\Delta$ of graph $G$, where contribute vital roles in determining connection, shading, component incorporation, and realisability where well-known Albertson index as: $\operatorname{irr}(G)=\sum_{uv\in E(G)}\lvert d_u(G)-d_v(G) \rvert$. The sigma index on trees that we introduced as $\sigma(T)=(d_1-1)^3+\sum_{i=1}^{3}(d_i-1)(d_i-2)+(d_3-1)^3$.
