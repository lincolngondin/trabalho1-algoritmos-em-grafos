AC State Estimation (ACSE) is widely recognized as a practical approach for determining the grid states in steady-state conditions. It serves as a fundamental analysis to ensure grid security and is a reference for market dispatch. As grid complexity increases with rapid electrification and decarbonization, there is a growing need for more accurate knowledge of the grid operating state. However, existing ACSE algorithms have technical gaps. Critically, current ACSE algorithms are susceptible to erroneous system parameters, which are assumed to be fixed in traditional approaches. In this paper, we build a novel circuit-theoretic joint parameter-state estimation algorithm to address this limitation. The innovative algorithm builds an analogous equivalent circuit of the grid with states and certain parameters unknown. It solves a circuit-constrained optimization to estimate the most likely grid states and parameters given a set of measurements. Further, it quantifies the goodness of the estimated output by formulating tight convex envelopes around the original non-convex problem to quantify the quality of estimates. We compare the various proposed approaches on systems with up to 2869 nodes while demonstrating a tradeoff between solution optimality and model fidelity.
