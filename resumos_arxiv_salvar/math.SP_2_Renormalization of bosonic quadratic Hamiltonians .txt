In this article, we study the renormalization of a bosonic quadratic Hamiltonian with an ultraviolet divergence. The Hamiltonian is composed of the sum of a free energy and the square of the smeared field operator. We explicitly diagonalize the Hamiltonian via Bogoliubov transformations, and the diagonalized Hamiltonian is easier to study. We show a renormalization of both the energy and the coupling constant depending on the form factor of the interaction.
