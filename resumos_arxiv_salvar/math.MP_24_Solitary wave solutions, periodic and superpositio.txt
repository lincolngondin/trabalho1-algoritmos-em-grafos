This article concludes the study of (2+1)-dimensional nonlinear wave equations that can be derived in a model of an ideal fluid with irrotational motion. In the considered case of identical scaling of the $x,y$ variables, obtaining a (2+1)-dimensional wave equation analogous to the KdV equation is impossible. Instead, from a system of two first-order Boussinesq equations, a non-linear wave equation for the auxiliary function $f(x,y,z)$ defining the velocity potential can be obtained, and only from its solutions can the surface wave form $\eta(x,y,z)$ be obtained. We demonstrate the existence of families of (2+1)-dimensional traveling wave solutions, including solitary and periodic solutions, of both cnoidal and superposition types.
