In this paper, we investigate a resonant system comprising $N$ closely packed spherical resonators ($N>2$). We analyze how the spatial arrangement of these resonators influences the distribution of resonant frequencies, focusing on leading-order terms. Furthermore, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of resonant modes linked to their respective frequencies. Our results demonstrate distinct trends across configurations: For single-row alignment, the system exhibits $N$ clearly separated resonant frequencies; For multi-row arrangements, the resonant frequency range broadens, though the total number of frequencies may diminish; while for ring configurations, comparable frequency ranges to chain arrangements emerge, but with fewer resonant frequencies. We derive explicit analytical expressions to quantify these frequency distributions. Regarding resonant modes, we identify that at specific frequencies, the gradient of these modes may exhibit different asymptotic behavior between different resonators.
