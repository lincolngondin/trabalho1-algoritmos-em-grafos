Phase mixing has long been understood to be a viable mechanism for expediting the dissipation of Alfvén wave energy resulting in the subsequent heating of the solar atmosphere. To fulfil the conditions necessary for phase mixing to occur, we consider the cross-field gradient in the Alfvén speed as a free parameter in our model. Using a single-fluid description of a partially ionized chromospheric plasma, we explore the efficiency of damping of shear Alfvén waves subject to phase mixing when a pulse wave driver is employed. Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of the dissipation length of shear Alfvén waves on both the ionization degree of the plasma and the gradient of the Alfvén speed. When assessing the efficiency of phase mixing across various inhomogeneities, our findings indicate that waves originating from a pulse driver exhibit initially identical heating rates as those generated by a continuous wave driver. One key difference observed was that Alfvén pulses possess a lower overall decay rate due to a change in damping profile from exponential to algebraic. This discrepancy arises from the absence of a consistent injection of energy into the base of the domain, that preserves longitudinal gradients of the magnetic field perturbations more effectively. These findings demonstrate the importance of understanding the relations between the wave driver, damping mechanisms, and propagation dynamics in resolving the atmospheric heating problem.
