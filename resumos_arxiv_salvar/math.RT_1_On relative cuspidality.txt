Let $(\mathbb{G},\mathbb{H})$ be a symmetric pair of reductive groups over a $p$-adic field with $p\neq 2$, attached to the involution $\theta$. Under the assumption that there exists a maximally $\theta$-split torus in $\mathbb{G}$, which is anisotropic modulo its intersection with the split component of $\mathbb{G}$, we extend Beuzart-Plessis' proof of existence of cuspidal representations, and prove that $\mathbb{G}(F)$ admits strongly relatively cuspidal representations. This confirms expectations of Kato and Takano.
