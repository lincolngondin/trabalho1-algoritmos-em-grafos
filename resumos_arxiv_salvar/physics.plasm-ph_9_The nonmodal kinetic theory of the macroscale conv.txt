In this paper, we develop the nonmodal kinetic theory of the macroscale convective flows of magnetized plasma, which stem from the average motion of ions and electrons in the electric field of the spatially inhomogeneous microturbulence. This theory bases on the two-scales approach to the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations for magnetized plasma, in which the solutions depend simultaneously on micro and macro scales. The developed theory predicts the generation of the sheared poloidal convective flow and of the radial compressed flow with radial flow velocity gradient. It was found that the macroscale (radial) inhomogeneity of the spectral intensity of the microturbulence is the condition necessary for the development of the two-dimensional non-diffusive convective plasma flows. The developed theory includes the theory of the evolution of the microscale turbulence in the sheared-compressed convective flows, formed by the microturbulence, and the theory of the slow macroscale evolution of a bulk of plasma by the compressed-sheared convective flows.
