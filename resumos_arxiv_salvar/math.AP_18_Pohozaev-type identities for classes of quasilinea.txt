In this article, we establish Pohozaev-type identities for a class of quasilinear elliptic equations and systems involving both local and nonlocal $p$-Laplace operators. Specifically, we obtain these identities in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for the purely anisotropic $p$-Laplace equations, the purely fractional $p$-Laplace equations, as well as for equations that incorporate both anisotropic and fractional $p$-Laplace features. We also extend these results to the corresponding systems. To the best of our knowledge, the identities we derive in the mixed case are new even when $p=2$. Finally, we illustrate some of the applications of our main results.
