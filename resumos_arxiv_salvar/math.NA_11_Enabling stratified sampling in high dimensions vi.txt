We consider the problem of propagating the uncertainty from a possibly large number of random inputs through a computationally expensive model. Stratified sampling is a well-known variance reduction strategy, but its application, thus far, has focused on models with a limited number of inputs due to the challenges of creating uniform partitions in high dimensions. To overcome these challenges, we perform stratification with respect to the uniform distribution defined over the unit interval, and then derive the corresponding strata in the original space using nonlinear dimensionality reduction. We show that our approach is effective in high dimensions and can be used to further reduce the variance of multifidelity Monte Carlo estimators.
