The Elastic Analysis Facility (EAF) hosted at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) is a platform being developed with the goal of providing a fast and efficient facility for physics analysis. As high-energy physics moves towards collecting larger datasets, such as those from the High-Luminosity LHC, the EAF strives to provide a powerful and adaptable framework for future colliders and multi-experiment institutions. Currently, the EAF supports several experiments including CMS, NOvA, and DUNE as well as serving accelerator physicists and beam line operations through integrated software and secure connections to Fermilab's computing resources. In addition, the EAF was designed with a user-friendly interface, intended to be more intuitive for emerging generations of physicists, that is still accessible for established styles of analysis. The EAF can also achieve better analysis efficiency due to the modernization of software and tools that can better utilize Fermilab's computing power. Furthermore, its design incorporates industry standards whenever possible, enhancing its sustainability and making it a possible template for other national or international laboratories and research facilities. Overall, the EAF is a forward-looking solution that will meet the evolving needs of particle physics, ensuring readiness for future colliders and multi-experiment research institutions.
