The Szeg√∂-Dirichlet kernel of the right half-plane $\mathbb H_{1/2}$ is given by ${\varkappa}(s, u) = \zeta(s+\overline{u}),$ $s, u \in \mathbb H_{1/2},$ where $\zeta$ denotes the Riemann zeta function. We show that none of the positive integer powers of $\varkappa$ has $2$-point scalar Pick property. Nevertheless, a network realization formula for the right half-plane $\mathbb H_0$ is obtained.
