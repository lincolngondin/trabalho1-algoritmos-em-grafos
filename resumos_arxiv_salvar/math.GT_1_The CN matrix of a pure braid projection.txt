The CN matrix of an $n$-braid projection $B$ is an $n \times n$ matrix such that each $(i,j)$ entry indicates the number of crossings between $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ strands of $B$. In this paper, patterns of an $n \times n$ matrix to be a CN matrix are discussed and the CN matrix of a pure 6-braid projection is characterized. As an application, the OU matrix of a pure 6-braid diagram and the crossing matrix of a positive pure 6-braid are also characterized.
