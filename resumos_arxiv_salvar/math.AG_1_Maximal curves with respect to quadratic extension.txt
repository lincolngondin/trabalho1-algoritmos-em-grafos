We propose a detailed study of a canonical bound which relates the numbers of rational points of a curve over a finite field with that over its quadratic extension. Alternative proofs which relate to the variance enable to complete the inequality in a symmetrical way and to obtain optimal refinements. We focus on the curves reaching the bound, which we call Diophantinemaximal curves. We provide different characterizations and stress natural links with the curves which attain the Ihara bound. As consequences, we establish the list of such curves with low genus and we outline a maximality result which involves the Suzuki curves.  At last we determine which polynomials correspond to the Jacobian of a Diophantine-maximal curve of genus 2.
