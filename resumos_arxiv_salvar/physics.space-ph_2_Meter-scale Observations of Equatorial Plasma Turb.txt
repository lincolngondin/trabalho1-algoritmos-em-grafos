The multi-Needle Langmuir Probe collects an electron current through four fixed-bias cylindrical copper needles. This allows for an extremely high sampling frequency, with plasma properties being inferred through polynomial fitting in the current-voltage plane. We present initial results from such a multi-needle probe mounted on the International Space Station, orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 400 km. That altitude, and its orbital inclination (~50 degrees), place the ISS as a suitable platform for observing equatorial plasma bubbles. In case studies of such turbulent structuring of the F-region plasma, we observe density timeseries that conserve considerable detail at virtually every level of magnification down to its Nyquist scale of 2-5 meters. We present power spectral density estimates of the turbulent structuring found inside equatorial plasma bubbles, and we discuss apparent break-points at scale-sizes between 1 m and 300 m, which we interpret in the light of turbulent dissipation as kilometer-scale swirls produced by the gradient-drift instability dissipate in the plasma.
