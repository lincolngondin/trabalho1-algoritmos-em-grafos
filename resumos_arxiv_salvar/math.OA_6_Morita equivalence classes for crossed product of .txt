We study the Morita equivalence classes of crossed products of rotation algebras $A_\theta$, where $\theta$ is a rational number, by finite and infinite cyclic subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$. We show that for any such subgroup $F$, the crossed products $A_\theta \rtimes F$ and $A_{\theta'} \rtimes F$ are strongly Morita equivalent, where both $\theta$ and $\theta'$ are rational. Combined with previous results for irrational values of $\theta$, our result provides a complete classification of the crossed products $A_\theta \rtimes F$ up to Morita equivalence.
