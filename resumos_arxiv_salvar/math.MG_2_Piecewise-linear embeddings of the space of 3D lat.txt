We present two methods to continuously and piecewise-linearly parametrize rank-3 lattices by vectors of $\RR^{13}$, which provides an efficient way to judge if two sets of parameters provide nearly identical lattices within their margins of errors. Such a parametrization can be used to speed up scientific computing involving periodic structures in $\RR^3$ such as crystal structures, which includes database querying, detection of duplicate entries, and structure generation via deep learning techniques. One gives a novel application of Conway's vonorms and conorms, and another is achieved through a natural extension of Ry{\u s}hkov's $C$-type to the setting modulo $3$. Voronoi vectors modulo 3 obtained in the latter approach provide an algorithm for enumerating of all potential isometries under perturbations of lattice parameters.
