We present a system that transforms speech into physical objects using 3D generative AI and discrete robotic assembly. By leveraging natural language input, the system makes design and manufacturing more accessible to individuals without expertise in 3D modeling or robotic programming. While current generative AI models can produce a wide range of 3D digital assets, AI-generated meshes are not directly suitable for robotic fabrication and do not account for fabrication constraints. To address this, we contribute a workflow that integrates natural language processing, 3D generative AI, and discrete robotic assembly. The system automatically analyzes and modifies AI-generated geometry to meet physical constraints, such as component count, overhangs, and connectivity, and produces a feasible robotic assembly sequence and toolpath. The results are demonstrated through the assembly of various objects, ranging from chairs to shelves, which are prompted via speech and realized within 5 minutes using a robotic arm.
