In this paper, we explore the geometry of potential triples $(X,\Delta,D)$, which consists of a pair $(X,\Delta)$ and a pseudoeffective divisor $D$. They can be considered as a generalization of generalized pairs. The asymptotic multiplier ideal sheaf $\mathcal{J}(X,\Delta;\lVert D \rVert)$ associated to a potential triple gives a simultaneous generalization of the multiplier ideal sheaf $\mathcal{J}(X,\Delta)$ and asymptotic multiplier ideal sheaf $\mathcal{J}(\lVert D \rVert)$. We also characterize the case where $\mathcal{J}(X,\Delta;\lVert D \rVert)=\mathcal{O}_X$. Lastly, we prove a Nadel type vanishing theorem of cohomology for $\mathcal{J}(X,\Delta;\lVert D \rVert)$. As an application, we also prove that we can run the $(K_X+\Delta+D)$-MMP with scaling of an ample divisor for a pklt triple $(X,\Delta,D)$.
