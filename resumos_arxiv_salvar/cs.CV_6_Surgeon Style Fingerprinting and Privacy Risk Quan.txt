Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles due to differences in training, experience, and motor behavior - yet current AI systems often ignore this personalization signal. We propose a novel approach to model fine-grained, surgeon-specific fingerprinting in robotic surgery using a discrete diffusion framework integrated with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Our method formulates gesture prediction as a structured sequence denoising task, conditioned on multimodal inputs including endoscopic video, surgical intent language, and a privacy-aware embedding of surgeon identity and skill. Personalized surgeon fingerprinting is encoded through natural language prompts using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon. To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage. These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical modeling.
