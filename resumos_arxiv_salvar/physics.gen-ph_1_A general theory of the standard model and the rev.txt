A General Theory of the Standard Model (GSM) is built in a spin-related gravigauge spacetime, based on the conformal inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry WS$_c$(1,3)=SP(1,3)$\rtimes$W$^{1,3}$$\rtimes$SP$_c$(1,1) and the scaling gauge symmetry SG(1), alongside the Standard Model symmetry U$_Y$(1)$\times$SU$_L$(2)$\times$SU(3)$_c$. This framework introduces novel interactions, including spin gauge force, chirality boost-spin force, chiral conformal-spin force, and scaling gauge force. A gravitization equation is derived to describe the gravitational effects arising from the non-commutative derivative operator in gravigauge spacetime. Within the Gravitational Quantum Field Theory (GQFT), the gravitational interaction is mediated by the gravigauge field, identified as the massless graviton. Both gauge-type and geometric-type gravitational equations are established, extending the description of gravidynamics beyond general relativity. A massive chirality boost-spin gauge boson, referred to as the dark graviton, emerges as a dark matter candidate, interacting with leptons and quarks via a spin gauge boson. Additionally, the fundamental scalar fields serve as sources of primordial energy and dark energy, driving early cosmic inflation and the current accelerated expansion of the universe.
