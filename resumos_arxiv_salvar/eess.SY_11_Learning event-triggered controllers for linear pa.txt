Nonlinear dynamical behaviours in engineering applications can be approximated by linear-parameter varying (LPV) representations, but obtaining precise model knowledge to develop a control algorithm is difficult in practice. In this paper, we develop the data-driven control strategies for event-triggered LPV systems with stability verifications. First, we provide the theoretical analysis of ${\theta}$-persistence of excitation for LPV systems, which leads to the feasible data-based representations. Then, in terms of the available perturbed data, we derive the stability certificates for event-triggered LPV systems with the aid of Petersen's lemma in the sense of robust control, resulting in the computationally tractable semidefinite programmings, the feasible solutions of which yields the optimal gain schedulings. Besides, we generalize the data-driven eventtriggered LPV control methods to the scenario of reference trajectory tracking, and discuss the robust tracking stability accordingly. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of our theoretical derivations by numerical simulations.
