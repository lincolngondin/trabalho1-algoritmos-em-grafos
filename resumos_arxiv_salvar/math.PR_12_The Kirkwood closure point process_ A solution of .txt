The Kirkwood superposition is a well-known tool in statistical physics to approximate the $n$-point correlation functions for $n\geq 3$ in terms of the density $\rho $ and the radial distribution function $g$ of the underlying system. However, it is unclear whether these approximations are themselves the correlation functions of some point process. If they are, this process is called the Kirkwood closure process. For the case that $g$ is the negative exponential of some nonnegative and regular pair potential $u$ existence of the the Kirkwood closure process was proved by Ambartzumian and Sukiasian. This result was generalized to the case that $u$ is a locally stable and regular pair potential by Kuna, Lebowitz and Speer, provided that $\rho$ is sufficiently small. In this work, it is shown that it suffices for $u$ to be stable and regular to ensure the existence of the Kirkwood closure process. Furthermore, for locally stable $u$ it is proved that the Kirkwood closure process is Gibbs and that the kernel of the GNZ-equation satisfies a Kirkwood-Salsburg type equation.
