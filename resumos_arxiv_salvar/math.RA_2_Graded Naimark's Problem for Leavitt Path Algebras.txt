In this paper we study the graded version of Naimark's problem for Leavitt path algebras considering them as $\mathbb{Z}$-graded algebras. Several characterizations are obtained of a Leavitt path algebra $L$ of an arbitrary graph $E$ over a field $\mathbb{K}$ over which any two graded-simple modules are graded isomorphic. Such a Leavitt path algebra $L$ is shown to be graded isomorphic to the algebra of graded infinite matrices having at most finitely many non-zero entries from the ring $R$ where $R=\mathbb{K}$ or $R=\mathbb{K}[x,x^{-1}]$. Equivalently, $L$ is a graded-simple ring which is graded-semisimple, that is, $L$ is a graded direct sum of graded-isomorphic graded-simple left $L$-modules. Graphically, the graph $E$ is shown to be row-finite, downward directed and the vertex set $E^{0}$ is the hereditary saturated closure of a single vertex $v$ which is either a line point or lies on a cycle without exits. We also characterize Leavitt path algebras possessing at most countably many isomorphism classes of graded-simple left modules. Examples are constructed illustrating these results.
