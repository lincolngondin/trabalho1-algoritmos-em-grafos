Computer simulations are indispensable for analyzing complex systems, yet high-fidelity models often incur prohibitive computational costs. Multi-fidelity frameworks address this challenge by combining inexpensive low-fidelity simulations with costly high-fidelity simulations to improve both accuracy and efficiency. However, certain scientific problems demand even more accurate results than the highest-fidelity simulations available, particularly when a tuning parameter controlling simulation accuracy is available, but the exact solution corresponding to a zero-valued parameter remains out of reach. In this paper, we introduce the Diffusion Non-Additive (DNA) model, inspired by generative diffusion models, which captures nonlinear dependencies across fidelity levels using Gaussian process priors and extrapolates to the exact solution. The DNA model: (i) accommodates complex, non-additive relationships across fidelity levels; (ii) employs a nonseparable covariance kernel to model interactions between the tuning parameter and input variables, improving both predictive performance and physical interpretability; and (iii) provides closed-form expressions for the posterior predictive mean and variance, allowing efficient inference and uncertainty quantification. The methodology is validated on a suite of numerical studies and real-world case studies. An R package implementing the proposed methodology is available to support practical applications.
