Automated testing has become a standard practice in software engineering, yet the creation of test models and suites remains labor-intensive. To reduce this effort, we developed an open-source tool that automatically generates Model-Based Testing (MBT) models from clickstream data collected during user interaction with web applications. The tool captures UI events, transforms them into state-transition models, and exports the result in a format compatible with the GraphWalker MBT tool. This enables immediate test execution without the need for manual model creation. The approach lowers the barrier to MBT adoption by leveraging actual usage behavior and reducing the reliance on upfront modeling. This technical report documents the system requirements, design decisions, implementation details, testing process, and empirical evaluation of the tool, which is publicly available as open-source.
