In the area of Tame Geometry, different model-theoretic tameness conditions are established and their relationships are analyzed. We construct a subfield $K$ of the real numbers that lacks several of such tameness properties. As our main result, we present a first-order formula in the language of rings that defines a non-Borel set in $K$. Moreover, $K$ has the independence property and admits both archimedean and non-archimedean orderings.
