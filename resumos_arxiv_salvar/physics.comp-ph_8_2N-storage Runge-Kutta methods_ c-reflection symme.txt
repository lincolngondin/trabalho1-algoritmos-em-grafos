Low-storage Runge-Kutta schemes of Williamson's type, so-called 2N-storage schemes, are further examined as a follow-up to the recent work. It is found that the augmented Butcher tableau factorizes into a product of matrices with special properties. Those properties reveal that the 2N-storage methods of the order of global accuracy less than five possess a symmetry, called c-reflection symmetry, i.e. most methods exist in pairs. A transformation that relates the Butcher tableaux of the pairs is found and the fact that the c-reflected method satisfies the same order conditions as the original one is proven. Numerical evidence that validates the analytic results is presented. Branches of solutions for (5,4) methods, first explored by Carpenter and Kennedy, are constructed numerically. Four new (5,4) schemes with coefficients expressed in radicals and one with rational coefficients are examined for illustration. Eight new (6,4) schemes, some of which can be expressed in rationals or radicals, and one (8,4) scheme, are studied to understand the practical implications of the c-reflection symmetry for methods with higher number of stages. In the absence of closed-form analytic solutions for 2N-storage Runge-Kutta methods of order four and above, the general symmetry properties, as well as some specific analytic solutions presented here, may help in development and optimization of 2N-storage schemes.
