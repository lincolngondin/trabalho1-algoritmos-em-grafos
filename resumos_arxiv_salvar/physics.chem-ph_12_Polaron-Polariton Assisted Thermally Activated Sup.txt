We predict an anomalous thermally activated superradiance in molecular aggregates within polaritonic environments. In contrast to free space, the collective emission is enhanced when either the exciton-phonon coupling or the temperature increases. This counterintuitive phenomenon is captured by a microscopic theory that combines macroscopic quantum electrodynamics with a modified polaron quantum master equation approach, revealing a nontrivial interplay among excitons, phonons, and polaritons.
