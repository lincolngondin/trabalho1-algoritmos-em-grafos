We generalize to all levels of the tower of coverings of the Drinfeld upper plane an exact sequence established by Lue Pan for the first covering. Furthermore, we introduce two functors, inspired by the categorification of the $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence, in Banach and locally analytic versions respectively. We then compute the sheaves associated with the representations appearing in our sequence. As an application, we show that all proper quotients of the universal unitary completion of a supercuspidal representation have finite length.
