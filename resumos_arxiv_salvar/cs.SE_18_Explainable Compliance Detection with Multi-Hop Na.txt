Ensuring complex systems meet regulations typically requires checking the validity of assurance cases through a claim-argument-evidence framework. Some challenges in this process include the complicated nature of legal and technical texts, the need for model explanations, and limited access to assurance case data. We propose a compliance detection approach based on Natural Language Inference (NLI): EXplainable CompLiance detection with Argumentative Inference of Multi-hop reasoning (EXCLAIM). We formulate the claim-argument-evidence structure of an assurance case as a multi-hop inference for explainable and traceable compliance detection. We address the limited number of assurance cases by generating them using large language models (LLMs). We introduce metrics that measure the coverage and structural consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated assurance case from GDPR requirements in a multi-hop inference task as a case study. Our results highlight the potential of NLI-based approaches in automating the regulatory compliance process.
