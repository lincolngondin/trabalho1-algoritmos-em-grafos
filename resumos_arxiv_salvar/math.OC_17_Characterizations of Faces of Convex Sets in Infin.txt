In the paper three different characterizations of faces of convex sets, belonging to infinite-dimensional real vector spaces, are presented. The first one is formulated in the terms of generalized semispaces, the second -- in the terms of compatible complete (total) preorders, and the third -- in the terms of step-affine functions. All three characterization are equivalent each other and extend to infinite-dimensional vector spaces the lexicographical characterization of faces established in finite-dimensional settings by Martinez-Legaz J.-E. (Acta Mathematica Vietnamica. 1997. Vol. 22, No.~1, P. 207--211).
