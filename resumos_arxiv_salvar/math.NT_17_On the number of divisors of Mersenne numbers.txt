Denote $f(n):=\sum_{1\le k\le n} \tau(2^k-1)$, where $\tau$ is the number of divisors function. Motivated by a question of Paul Erd≈ës, we show that the sequence of ratios $f(2n)/f(n)$ is unbounded. We also present conditional results on the divergence of this sequence to infinity. Finally, we test numerically both the conjecture $f(2n)/f(n)\to\infty$ and our sufficient conditions for it to hold.
