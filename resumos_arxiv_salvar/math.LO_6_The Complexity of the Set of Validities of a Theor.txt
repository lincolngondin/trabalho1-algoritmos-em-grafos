We study the collection of first-order logical schemata all of whose instances are theorems of a given theory $T$; we call these the validities of $T$ ($\mathsf{V}(T)$). It is easy to see that if $T$ is a decidable theory, then $\mathsf{V}(T)$ is distinct from the set of valid formulas of first-order logic as customarily understood. We provide a complete model-theoretic characterization of the complexity, in the sense of Turing degree, of $\mathsf{V}(T)$ for decidable theories $T$, and answer a question posed by Vaught in 1960 concerning the complexity of the collection of validities common to all decidable theories.
