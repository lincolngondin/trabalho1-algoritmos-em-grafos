With the rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) networks, detecting malicious traffic in real-time has become a critical cybersecurity challenge. This research addresses the detection challenges by presenting a comprehensive empirical analysis of machine learning techniques for malware detection using the IoT-23 dataset provided by the Stratosphere Laboratory. We address the significant class imbalance within the dataset through three resampling strategies. We implement and compare a few machine learning techniques. Our findings demonstrate that the combination of appropriate imbalance treatment techniques with ensemble methods, particularly gcForest, achieves better detection performance compared to traditional approaches. This work contributes significantly to the development of more intelligent and efficient automated threat detection systems for IoT environments, helping to secure critical infrastructure against sophisticated cyber attacks while optimizing computational resource usage.
