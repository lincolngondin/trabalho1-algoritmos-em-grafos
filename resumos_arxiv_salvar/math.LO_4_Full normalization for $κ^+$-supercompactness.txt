We extend the normalization results of the author's paper "Full normalization for transfinite stacks" [5] to mice at the level of $\kappa^+$-supercompactness: given a normal iteration strategy $\Sigma$ for such a mouse $M$, with both $M$ and $\Sigma$ satisfying certain condensation properties, we extend $\Sigma$ to a strategy $\Sigma^*$ for stacks of normal trees, such that every iterate via $\Sigma^*$ is in fact a normal iterate via $\Sigma$.
