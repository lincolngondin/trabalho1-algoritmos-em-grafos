In this paper, we introduce DynaRoute, an adaptive joint optimization framework for dynamic vehicular networks that simultaneously addresses platoon control and data transmission through trajectory-aware routing and safety-constrained vehicle coordination. DynaRoute guarantees continuous vehicle movement via platoon safety control with optimizing transmission paths through real-time trajectory prediction and ensuring reliable data. Our solution achieves three key objectives: (1) maintaining platoon stability through accurate data transmission, (2) enabling adaptive routing based on vehicle movement patterns, and (3) enhancing overall intelligent transportation system performance. DynaRoute equires predefined traffic models and adapts to dynamic network conditions using local vehicle state information. We present comprehensive simulation results demonstrating that DynaRoute maintains control and transmission performance in multiple complex scenarios while significantly improving throughput and reliability compared to traditional approaches.
