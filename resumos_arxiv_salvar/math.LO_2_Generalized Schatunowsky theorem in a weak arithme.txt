Schatunowsky's 1893 theorem, that 30 is the largest number all of whose totatives are primes, has been recently generalized by Kaneko and Nakai. In its generalized form, it states the finiteness of the set of all positive numbers $n$, which, for a fixed prime $p$, have the property that all of $n$'s totatives that are not divisible by any prime less than or equal to $p$ are prime numbers. It is this generalized form that we show holds in a weak arithmetic
