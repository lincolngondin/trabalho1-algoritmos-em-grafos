Our main result is a description of the spectrum of bidual algebra $A^{**}$ of a uniform algebra $A$. This allows us to obtain abstract corona theorem for certain uniform algebras, asserting density of a specific Gleason part in the spectrum of an $H^\infty$ -- type subalgebra of $A^{**}$.
There is an isometric isomorphism of the latter subalgebra with $H^\infty(G)$ for a wide class of domains $G\subset\mathbb C^d$. Using abstract corona theorem we show the density of the canonical image of $G$ in the spectrum of $H^\infty(G)$, solving positively corona problem for this class (which in particular includes balls and polydisks).
