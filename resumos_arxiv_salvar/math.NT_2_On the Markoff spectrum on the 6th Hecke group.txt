The discrete part of the Markoff spectrum on the 6th Hecke group $\mathbf H_6$ was known by A. Schmidt. In this paper, we study the Markoff and Lagrange spectra on $\mathbf H_6$ after the smallest accumulation point $4/\sqrt{3}$. We show that both spectra below $4/\sqrt{3} + \epsilon$ have positive Hausdorff dimension for any positive $\epsilon$. We also find maximal gaps and an isolated point in the spectra.
