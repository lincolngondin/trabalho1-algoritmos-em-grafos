Let A be an n*n symmetric random matrix with independent, non-constant subgaussian entries (not necessarily identically distributed). In this paper, we introduce a distance theorem. Building on this theorem, we analyze the eigenvalues of A to derive probability inequalities for the eigenvalue gaps of A. Moreover, we determine the probability for the smallest singular value of a submatrix of A. This enables us to obtain the probability of delocalization of the eigenvectors of A.
