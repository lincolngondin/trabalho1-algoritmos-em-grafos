Freeness of multiarrangements is extremely important in the study of freeness of hyperplane arrangements. In particular, the exponents of 2-multiarrangement play an important role in freeness of 3-arrangement. However, it is not easy to compute exponents in general. Wakamiko (2007) determined bases and the exponents for multiarrangements of three lines over a field of characteristic zero. In this paper, we study the exponents of multiarrangements of three lines for the case of positive characteristic. We provide an effective algorithm for computing the exponents. Furthermore, we prove that the multiplicity lattice has plenty of symmetries. We also discuss the validity of bases constructed from binomial expansions in the case of positive characteristic.
