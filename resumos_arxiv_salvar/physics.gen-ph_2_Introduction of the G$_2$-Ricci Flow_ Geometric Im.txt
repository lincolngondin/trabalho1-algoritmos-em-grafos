This work introduces the G$_2$-Ricci flow on seven-dimensional manifolds with non-zero torsion and explores its physical implications. By extending the Ricci flow to manifolds with G$_2$ structures, we study the evolution of solitonic solutions and their role in spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories. In particular, this model proposes that the masses of the W and Z bosons are determined not by an external scalar field, as in the Higgs mechanism, but by the intrinsic geometric torsion of the manifold. Furthermore, a possible connection between the geometry of extra dimensions and the curvature of our spacetime is explored, with implications for the experimentally observed positive cosmological constant. This approach provides an innovative interpretation of fundamental interactions in theoretical physics, opening new possibilities for studying extra dimensions and the geometry of G$_2$-manifolds.
