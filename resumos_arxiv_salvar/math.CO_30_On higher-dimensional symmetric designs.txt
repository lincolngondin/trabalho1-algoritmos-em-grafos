We study two kinds of generalizations of symmetric block designs to higher dimensions, the so-called $\mathcal{C}$-cubes and $\mathcal{P}$-cubes. For small parameters, all examples up to equivalence are determined by computer calculations. Known properties of automorphisms of symmetric designs are extended to autotopies of $\mathcal{P}$-cubes, while counterexamples are found for $\mathcal{C}$-cubes. An algorithm for the classification of $\mathcal{P}$-cubes with prescribed autotopy groups is developed and used to construct more examples. A bound on the dimension of difference sets for $\mathcal{P}$-cubes is proved and shown to be tight in elementary abelian groups. The construction is generalized to arbitrary groups by introducing regular sets of (anti)automorphisms.
