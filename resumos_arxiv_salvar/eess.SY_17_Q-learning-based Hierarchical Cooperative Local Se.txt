The steelmaking continuous casting scheduling problem (SCCSP) is a critical and complex challenge in modern steel production, requiring the coordinated assignment and sequencing of steel charges across multiple production stages. Efficient scheduling not only enhances productivity but also significantly reduces energy consumption. However, both traditional heuristics (e.g., two-stage local search) and recent metaheuristics often struggle to adapt to the dynamic characteristics of practical SCCSP instances. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel Q learning based hierarchical cooperative local search framework, termed HierC_Q, aimed at minimizing the weighted sum of the maximum completion time and the average waiting time in SCCSP. The core contributions of HierC_Q are twofold. First, considering the intrinsic coupling properties of the SCCSP, a dedicated reward function is proposed based on a novel coupling measure (CM), guiding the exploration process towards promising regions of the solution space. Second, a hierarchical architecture is devised, comprising two distinct tiers: the learn to improve (L2I) tier and the "disturb to renovate" (D2R) tier. The L2I tier performs deep exploitation within promising regions using two independent Q-learning-based local search frameworks (QLSFs) tailored for subproblems, along with a synergy QLSF designed for the main problem. To enhance the effectiveness of local search, a validity evaluation approach and a speed-up evaluation method are also intro-duced, grounded in a detailed study of the problem's structure. Meanwhile, the D2R tier incorporates a perturbation and construction based solution renewal strategy to mitigate the risk of premature convergence. The superiority and effectiveness of HierC_Q are demonstrated through extensive comparisons with eleven local search frameworks and nine state-of-the-art algorithms.
