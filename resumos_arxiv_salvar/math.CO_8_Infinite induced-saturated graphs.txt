A graph $G$ is $H$-induced-saturated if $G$ is $H$-free but deleting any edge or adding any edge creates an induced copy of $H$. There are various graphs $H$, such as $P_4$, for which no finite $H$-induced-saturated graph $G$ exists. We show that for every finite graph $H$ that is not a clique or stable set, there always exists a countable $H$-induced-saturated graph. In fact, a stronger property can be achieved: there is an $H$-free graph $G$ such that $G'$ contains a copy of $H$ whenever $G'\neq G$ is obtained from $G$ by deleting and adding edges so that only a finite number of changes have been made incident to any vertex.
