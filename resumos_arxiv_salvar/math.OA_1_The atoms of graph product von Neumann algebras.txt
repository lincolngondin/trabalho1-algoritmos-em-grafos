We completely classify the atomic summands in a graph product $(M,\varphi) = *_{v \in \mathcal{G}} (M_v,\varphi_v)$ of von Neumann algebras with faithful normal states. Each type I factor summand $(N,\psi)$ is a tensor product of type I factor summands $(N_v,\psi_v)$ in the individual algebras. The existence of such a summand and its weight in the direct sum can be determined from the $(N_v,\psi_v)$'s using explicit polynomials associated to the graph.
