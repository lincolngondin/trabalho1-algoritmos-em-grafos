For over a century, the response of magnetic materials to static fields, formulated as transmission problems of the Laplace equation, has been a standard topic in undergraduate electrodynamics. In the infinite permeability limit, the body becomes nearly equipotential and the internal magnetic field nearly vanishes, giving rise to magnetostatic shielding, a phenomenon in which the magnetic induction is nearly zero throughout the interior free space. While this textbook-level result has long been considered fully understood, here, we identify a previously overlooked geometric invariance that complements the quasi-equipotential picture: in the same limit, the entire external magnetic response of a body is determined solely by its outer surface geometry, regardless of internal structure or deformation, as long as the outer surface remains fixed. This surface-encoded invariance encompasses the external field distribution and all magnetic multipole moments of the body, including the dipole and quadrupole, derived as volume integrals from the internal scalar potential. It provides a theoretical foundation for the lightweight design of certain magnetic devices, such as flux concentrators. Given that analogous Laplace transmission problems arise across physics, including electricity conduction, heat conduction and acoustic scattering, this geometric invariance exhibits cross-disciplinary universality. It merits inclusion in undergraduate electromagnetism curricula, as it and the quasi-equipotential property together form a complete characterization of Laplace transmission problems in the infinite permeability limit.
