We investigate the numerical stability of force-gradient integrators and their Hessian-free variants within the molecular dynamics step of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm in lattice QCD simulations. A linear stability analysis of (Hessian-free) force-gradient integrators is conducted by investigating the harmonic oscillator as a test equation. By performing detailed stability investigations for the entire family of self-adjoint integrators with up to eleven exponentials per time step, we detect promising integrator variants that are providing a good trade-off between accuracy and numerical stability. Simulations for the two-dimensional Schwinger model demonstrate that there are no significant differences in the stability domain of a force-gradient integrator and its Hessian-free counterpart. Furthermore, lattice QCD simulations are conducted to emphasize the significance of numerical stability as a metric for evaluating the computational efficiency of integrators when applied to lattice QCD simulations.
