The aim of this paper is to show that, for a class of non-cooperative elliptic systems on compact symmetric spaces, any continuum of nontrivial solutions bifurcating from the set of trivial solutions is unbounded. The main tool is the degree for invariant strongly indefinite functionals. The analysis relies on the torus-equivariant structure of the Laplace--Beltrami eigenspaces. The result is obtained by ruling out return to the trivial branch in an equivariant version of the Rabinowitz alternative.
