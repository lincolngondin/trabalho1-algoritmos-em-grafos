This study introduces a novel real-time betatron tune measurement algorithm, utilizing Schottky signals and an FPGA-based backend architecture, specifically designed for rapidly ramping synchrotrons, with particular application to the Shanghai Advanced Proton Therapy (SAPT) facility. The developed algorithm demonstrates improved measurement accuracy under challenging operational conditions, especially in scenarios with limited sampling time and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) as low as \(-20\) dB. By applying Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) analysis, the algorithm effectively accommodates the rapid increase in revolution frequency from 4 MHz to 7.5 MHz over 0.35 seconds, along with tune shifts. A macro-particle simulation methodology is employed to generate Schottky signals, which are then combined with real noise collected from an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to simulate practical conditions. The proposed betatron tune measurement algorithm integrates advanced spectral processing techniques and an enhanced peak detection algorithm specifically tailored for low SNR conditions. Experimental validation confirms the superior performance of the proposed algorithm over conventional approaches in terms of measurement accuracy, stability, and system robustness, while meeting the stringent operational requirements of proton therapy applications. This innovative approach effectively addresses critical limitations associated with Schottky diagnostics for betatron tune measurement in rapidly ramping synchrotrons operating under low SNR conditions, laying a robust foundation and providing a viable solution for advanced applications in proton therapy and related accelerator physics fields.
