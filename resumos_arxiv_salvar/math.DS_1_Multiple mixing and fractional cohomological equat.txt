We introduce the notion of the (multiple) fractional cohomological equation and, by studying its solutions, develop a novel framework to obtain the decay of matrix coefficients for partially hyperbolic algebraic actions. In particular, we show that mere partial HÃ¶lder regularity of \(L^2\) vectors is sufficient for exponential decay of matrix coefficients.
As an application, under the assumption of ergodicity, we obtain explicit and sharp exponential mixing rates of all orders for a large class of partially hyperbolic algebraic actions. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of irrational automorphisms on nilmanifolds and prove that these automorphisms exhibit super-exponential mixing of all orders, marking the first such example in the literature.
