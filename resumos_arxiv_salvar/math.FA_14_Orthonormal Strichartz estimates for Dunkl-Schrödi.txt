Let $\Delta_\kappa$ be the Dunkl-Laplacian on $\mathbb{R}^n$. The main aim of this paper is to investigate the orthonormal Strichartz estimates for the Schrödinger equation with initial data from the homogeneous Dunkl-Sobolev space $\dot{H}_\kappa^s (\mathbb{R}^n)$. Our approach is based on restricted weak-type orthonormal estimates, frequency-localized estimates for the Dunkl-Schrödinger propagator $e^{it\Delta_\kappa}$, and a series of successive real and complex interpolation techniques.
