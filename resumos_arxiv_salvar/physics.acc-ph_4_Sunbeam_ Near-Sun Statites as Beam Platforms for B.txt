We outline a method of beamed power for propulsion that utilizes relativistic electron beams. The physics of charged particle beam propagation in the space plasma environment is discussed and the long-range (>100 A.U.) advantage of relativistic electron beams is emphasized. A preliminary statite based beam emitter for powering probes to ~0.1c is proposed and the challenges in beam-power uses are explored.
