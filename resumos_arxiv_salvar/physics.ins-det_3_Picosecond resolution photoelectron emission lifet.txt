This paper describes a new photoelectron emission lifetime detection system. It is based on a recently developed Radio Frequency Timing technique of keV electrons and a 40 MHz, ultrafast pulsed laser. The photoelectron emission lifetimes from gold, monolayer MoS$_2$ and monolayer graphene were measured. As expected, we do not observe delayed electrons from gold, and the time distribution of the produced photoelectrons represents the time resolution of the device, which is $\sim$12~ps. From the graphene, we observed delayed photoelectrons with a lifetime of $\sim$189~ps.
