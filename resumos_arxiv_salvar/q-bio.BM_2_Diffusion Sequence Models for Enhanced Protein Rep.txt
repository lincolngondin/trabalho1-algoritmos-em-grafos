Proteins are fundamental to biology, executing diverse functions through complex physicochemical interactions, and they hold transformative potential across medicine, materials science, and environmental applications. Protein Language Models (pLMs) aim to unlock insights from the vast space of unlabeled protein sequences by learning rich, semantic representations from primary sequences via masked language modeling. However, these models typically exhibit limited generative capacity. In this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequence Model (DSM), a novel pLM trained with masked diffusion to enable both high-quality representation learning and generative protein design. DSM builds upon the ESM2 architecture by incorporating a masked forward diffusion process inspired by the LLaDA framework. After training, DSM is capable of generating diverse, biomimetic sequences that align with expected amino acid compositions, secondary structures, and predicted functions, even with 90\% token corruption. Furthermore, DSM's learned representations match or exceed those of similarly sized pLMs on downstream tasks. We also introduce DSM(ppi), a variant fine-tuned to generate protein binders by attending to target sequences. We demonstrate DSM(ppi)'s effectiveness on the challenging Bench-tested Binder Benchmark (BenchBB), where both DSM and DSM(ppi) produce candidates with superior predicted binding affinity compared to known binders. Our results establish masked diffusion as a powerful paradigm for unifying protein representation and generation in a single framework.
