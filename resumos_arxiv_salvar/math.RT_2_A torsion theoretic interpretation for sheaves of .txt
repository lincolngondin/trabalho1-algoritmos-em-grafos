We prove that every Grothendieck topology induces a hereditary torsion pair in the category of presheaves of modules on a ringed site, and obtain a homological characterization of sheaves of modules: a presheaf of modules is a sheaf of modules if and only if it is saturated with respect to torsion presheaves, or equivalently, it is right perpendicular to torsion presheaves in the sense of Geigle and Lenzing. We also study Grothendieck topologies on directed categories $\mathscr{C}$, and show that every Grothendieck topology on $\mathscr{C}$ is a subcategory topology if and only if $\mathscr{C}$ is an artinian EI category. Consequently, in this case every sheaf category is equivalent to the presheaf category over a full subcategory of $\mathscr{C}$. Finally, we give a few potential applications of these results in group representation theory.
