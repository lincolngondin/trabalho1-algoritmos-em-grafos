Data availability is essential to develop acoustic signal processing algorithms, especially when it comes to data-driven approaches that demand large and diverse training datasets. For this reason, an increasing number of databases have been published in recent years, including either room impulse responses (RIRs) or recordings of moving audio. In this paper we introduce the trajectoRIR database, an extensive, multi-array collection of both dynamic and stationary acoustic recordings along a controlled trajectory in a room. Specifically, the database features recordings using moving microphones and stationary RIRs spatially sampling the room acoustics along an L-shaped, 3.74-meter-long trajectory. This combination makes trajectoRIR unique and applicable in various tasks ranging from sound source localization and tracking to spatially dynamic sound field reconstruction and system identification. The recording room has a reverberation time of 0.5 seconds, and the three different microphone configurations employed include a dummy head, with additional reference microphones located next to the ears, 3 first-order Ambisonics microphones, two circular arrays of 16 and 4 channels, and a 12-channel linear array. The motion of the microphones was achieved using a robotic cart traversing a rail at three speeds: [0.2,0.4,0.8] m/s. Audio signals were reproduced using two stationary loudspeakers. The collected database features 8648 stationary RIRs, as well as perfect sweeps, speech, music, and stationary noise recorded during motion. MATLAB and Python scripts are included to access the recorded audio as well as to retrieve geometrical information.
