McCullough and Miller constructed a contractible complex on which the pure symmetric automorphism group of a free group acts with free abelian stabilizers. This complex has been used for computations such as the cohomological dimension of these groups, their cohomology rings, and results about $\ell^2$-Betti numbers or BNRS-invariants. We generalize this construction to pure symmetric automorphism groups of arbitrary RAAGs and exhibit applications of this generalization.
