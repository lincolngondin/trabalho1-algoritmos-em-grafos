We investigate the evolution rules and degree distribution properties of the Software Heritage dataset, a large-scale, real-world growing network connecting software releases and revisions from open-source communities. The network comprises approximately 6 billion nodes and edges and spans more than 40 years of growth. Our analysis leverages natural partitions of nodes and edges, based on both temporal and topological attributes.
A derived temporalized graph reveals a global bow-tie-like structure and enables a preliminary investigation of edge dynamics (such as creation, inheritance, and aging) alongside comparisons with minimal models. We analyze degree distributions over time, edge timestamp histograms, and estimates of the in-degree distribution's scaling exponent. The results highlight the sensitivity of a widely used estimation method to regime changes and to the presence of numerous outliers, while showing that the proposed partitioning improves regularity and helps disentangle these effects.
Node types derived from topological and temporal partitions reveal regime shifts associated with changes in developer practices, notably variations in the average number of new edges per new node over time. These structural and dynamical transitions hinder definitive conclusions regarding the existence and observability of a scale-free regime, and underscore the need for advanced tools to study transient growth phases and to facilitate robust comparisons between real-world evolving networks and minimal models.
