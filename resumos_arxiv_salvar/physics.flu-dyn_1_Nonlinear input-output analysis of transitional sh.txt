Input-output analysis has been widely used to predict the transition to turbulence in wall-bounded shear flows, but it typically does not capture the full nonlinear effects involved. This work employs the Small-Signal Finite-Gain (SSFG) Lp stability theorem to assess nonlinear input-output amplification and demonstrates its applicability using a nine-mode shear flow model with a random body force. Our analysis employs Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) and Sum-of-Squares (SOS) as the primary tools to search for a quadratic Lyapunov function of an unforced nonlinear system certifying the SSFG Lp stability of a nonlinear input-output system. The predicted nonlinear input-output Lp gain (amplification) is consistent with numerical simulations; the Lp norm of the output from numerical simulations remains bounded by the theoretical prediction from the SSFG Lp stability theorem, with the gap between simulated and theoretical bounds narrowing as p approaches infinity. The input-output gain obtained from the nonlinear SSFG Lp stability theorem is higher than the linear Lp gain, which suggests that nonlinearity can significantly amplify small disturbances. The SSFG Lp stability theorem requires the input forcing to be smaller than a permissible forcing amplitude to maintain finite input-output gain, which is an inherently nonlinear behavior that cannot be predicted by linear input-output analysis. We also identify such permissible forcing amplitude using numerical simulations and bisection search, where below such forcing amplitude, the output norm at any time will be lower than a given threshold value. The permissible forcing amplitude identified from the SSFG Lp stability theorem is conservative but also consistent with that obtained by numerical simulations and bisection search.
