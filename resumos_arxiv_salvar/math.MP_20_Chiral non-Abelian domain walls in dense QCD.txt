In this paper, we study chiral non-Abelian domain walls in a phase of unconventional vacua of dense QCD. The phase is characterized by asymmetric vacuum-expectation values (VEVs), for example with the left scalar field, corresponding to the left quark-quark condensate, having a nonvanishing VEV and the right field having a vanishing one. The domain wall soliton interpolates between this vacuum and another where the left and right scalar fields switch roles. We contemplate that such vacua could possibly be generated non-perturbatively at very high densities in QCD. Using a strong-coupling, or sigma-model limit, we are able to reduce the full dynamical complex matrix valued equations of motion to the sine-Gordon, a generalization of the sine-Gordon and a generalization of the double sine-Gordon equations. In this limit, we prove nonexistence of domain walls in one of the vacua studied here and we find full numerical computations to converge to the sigma-model limit for many cases, with some exceptions that we discuss.
