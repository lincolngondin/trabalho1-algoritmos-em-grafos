Misuses of t-SNE and UMAP in visual analytics have become increasingly common. For example, although t-SNE and UMAP projections often do not faithfully reflect true distances between clusters, practitioners frequently use them to investigate inter-cluster relationships. In this paper, we bring this issue to the surface and comprehensively investigate why such misuse occurs and how to prevent it. We conduct a literature review of 114 papers to verify the prevalence of the misuse and analyze the reasonings behind it. We then execute an interview study to uncover practitioners' implicit motivations for using these techniques -- rationales often undisclosed in the literature. Our findings indicate that misuse of t-SNE and UMAP primarily stems from limited discourse on their appropriate use in visual analytics. We conclude by proposing future directions and concrete action items to promote more reasonable use of DR.
