This paper investigates the existence of solutions for a class of nonlinear higher-order dynamic equations subject to mixed boundary conditions. We consider boundary value problems in which the nonlinear reaction functions satisfy polynomial growth conditions both in the interior of the domain and on the boundary. Our analysis employs a systematic approach based on fixed-point theorems for expansive mappings combined with completely continuous operators to establish stronger existence results. Under appropriate growth conditions on the nonlinear terms, we first prove the existence of at least one classical solution, which is not guaranteed to be nonnegative. We then strengthen our hypotheses to establish the existence of at least three nonnegative solutions. The theoretical framework relies on cone theory and carefully constructed open bounded subsets within function spaces equipped with appropriate norms. Our methodology provides a unified approach to multiple solution problems for higher-order
