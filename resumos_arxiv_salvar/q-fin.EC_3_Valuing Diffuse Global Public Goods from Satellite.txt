This paper studies the welfare impact of discrete improvements to global public goods in the context of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Specifically, I find that by disabling Selective Availability in May, 2000, and thus significantly increasing the accuracy of GPS, the United States generated at least \$268 million (2000 dollars) of additional welfare gains. To quantify this welfare impact, I apply a difference-in-differences model to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics's Airline On-Time Performance Data in the years 1999 and 2000. I use this model to estimate the time saved per flight attributable to the improved GPS and multiply these time savings by the number of passengers in the ensuing year and their values of time. I conclude by estimating the economic loss from current threats to the provision of satellite-based global public goods.
