This paper presents a continuous-time output feedback adaptive control technique for stabilization and tracking control problems. The adaptive controller is motivated by the classical discrete-time retrospective cost adaptive control algorithm. The particle swarm optimization framework automates the adaptive algorithm's hyper-parameter tuning. The proposed controller is numerically validated in the tracking problems of a double integrator and a bicopter system and is experimentally validated in an attitude stabilization problem. Numerical and experimental results show that the proposed controller is an effective technique for model-free output feedback control.
