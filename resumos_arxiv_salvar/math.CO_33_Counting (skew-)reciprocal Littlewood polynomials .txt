A Littlewood polynomial is a single-variable polynomial all of whose coefficients lie in $\{ \pm 1\}$. We establish the leading term asymptotics of the number of reciprocal or skew-reciprocal Littlewood polynomials with square discriminant. This relates to a bounded-height analogue of the Van der Waerden conjecture on Galois groups of random polynomials. As a byproduct, we establish the asymptotics of certain Gaussian-weighted counts of Pythagorean triples.
