Artin vanishing theorems for Stein spaces refer to the vanishing of some of their (co)homology groups in degrees higher than the dimension. We obtain new positive and negative results concerning Artin vanishing for the cohomology of a Stein space relative to a Runge open subset. We also prove an Artin vanishing theorem for the Gal(C/R)-equivariant cohomology of a Gal(C/R)-equivariant Stein space relative to the fixed locus.
