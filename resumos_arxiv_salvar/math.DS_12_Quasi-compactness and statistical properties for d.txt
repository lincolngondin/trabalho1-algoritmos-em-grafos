In this paper, we establish the quasi-compactness of the transfer operator associated with skew product systems that are semi-conjugate to piecewise convex maps with a countably infinite number of branches. These non-invertible skew products admit discontinuities, with the critical set confined to a countable collection of fibers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such systems possess an invariant measure whose disintegration along the fibers exhibits bounded variation; a concept introduced and developed in this work.
