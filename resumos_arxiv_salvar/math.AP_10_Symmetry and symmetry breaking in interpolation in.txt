On the two-dimensional Euclidean space, we study a spinorial analogue of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality involving weighted gradient norms. This (SCKN) inequality is equivalent to a spinorial Gagliardo-Nirenberg type interpolation inequality on a cylinder as well as to an interpolation inequality involving Aharonov-Bohm magnetic fields, which was analyzed in a paper of 2020. We examine the symmetry properties of optimal functions by linearizing the associated functional around radial minimizers. We prove that the stability of the linearized problem is equivalent to the positivity of a $2\times2$ matrix-valued differential operator. We study the positivity issue via a combination of analytical arguments and numerical computations. In particular, our results provide numerical evidence that the region of symmetry breaking extends beyond what was previously known, while the threshold of the known symmetry region is linearly stable. Altogether, we obtain refined estimates of the phase transition between symmetry and symmetry breaking. Our results also put in evidence striking differences with the three-dimensional (SCKN) inequality that was recently investigated.
