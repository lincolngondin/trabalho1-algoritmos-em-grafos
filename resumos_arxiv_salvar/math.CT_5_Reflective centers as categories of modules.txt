In [LWY23] the authors construct the reflective center of a module category M over a braided monoidal category B. The reflective center is by construction a braided module category over B. In the case where B is the category of modules over a finite dimensional quasitriangular Hopf algebra H, acting on the category of modules over a comodule algebra, they construct a comodule algebra, the reflective algebra, whose modules are precisely the reflective center. In the construction, Majid's transmutation of H plays a crucial r{Ã´}le.  This note centers on the transmuted H, seeking to ''explain'' its appearance through a generalization in which the acting category is no longer a module category, but admits an internal reconstructed Hopf algebra; the transmutation is a special case of this notion. As a result, in certain cases, the reflective center is simply the category of modules in M over that Hopf algebra in B.
