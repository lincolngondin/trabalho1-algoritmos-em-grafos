Our goal of this paper is to give a complete characterization of all holomorphic invariant strongly pseudoconvex complex Finsler metrics on the classical domains and establish a corresponding Schwarz lemma for holomorphic mappings with respect to these invariant metrics. We prove that every $\mbox{Aut}(\mathfrak{D})$-invariant strongly pseudoconvex complex Finsler metric $F$ on a classical domain $\mathfrak{D}$ is a Kähler-Berwald metric which is not necessary Hermitian quadratic, but it enjoys very similar curvature property as that of the Bergman metric on $\mathfrak{D}$. In particular, if $F$ is Hermitian quadratic, then $F$ must be a constant multiple of the Bergman metric on $\mathfrak{D}$. This actually answers the $4$-th open problem posed by Bland and Kalka (Variations of holomorphic curvature for Kähler Finsler metrics, American Mathematical Society, 1996).We also obtain a general Schwarz lemma for holomorphic mappings from a classical domain $\mathfrak{D}_1$ into another classical domain $\mathfrak{D}_2$ whenever $\mathfrak{D}_1$ and $\mathfrak{D}_2$ are endowed with arbitrary holomorphic invariant Kähler-Berwald metrics $F_1$ and $F_2$, respectively. The method used to prove the Schwarz lemma is purely geometric. Our results show that the Lu constant of $(\mathfrak{D},F)$ is both an analytic invariant and a geometric invariant. This can be better understood in the complex Finsler setting.
