The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT), is an easy-to-compute feature extractor that facilitates image classification tasks especially in the small data regime. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and provably guaranties the linear separability of image classes that emerge from translations or scalings. In many real-world applications, like the recognition of watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine transformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this issue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only requires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary affine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the max-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against non-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its separability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance between the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance only allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a mean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the Wasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive noise for instance. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments showing the effectiveness of our novel feature extractors as well as their robustness against local non-affine deformations and impulsive noise.
