Digital terrorism is a major cause of securing patient/healthcare providers data and information. Sensitive topics that may have an impact on a patient's health or even national security include patient health records and information on healthcare providers. Health databases and data sets have been continually breached by many, regular assaults, as well as local and remote servers equipped with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in diverse locations. The problem was addressed by some contemporary strategies that were created to stop these assaults and guarantee the privacy of patient data and information transferred and gathered by sensors. Nevertheless, the literature analysis outlines many indications of weakness that persist in these methods. This study suggests a novel, reliable method that bolsters the information security and data gathered by sensors and kept on base station datasets. The proposed approach combines a number of security mechanisms, including symmetric cryptography for encryption, asymmetric cryptography for access control and signatures, and the Lesamnta-LW method in the signature process. Users' information is shielded from prying eyes by the careful application of these measures and a sound approach. Investigational comparisons, security studies, and thorough results show that the suggested method is better than earlier methods.
