In this work, we propose an attention-based deep reinforcement learning approach to address the adaptive informative path planning (IPP) problem in 3D space, where an aerial robot equipped with a downward-facing sensor must dynamically adjust its 3D position to balance sensing footprint and accuracy, and finally obtain a high-quality belief of an underlying field of interest over a given domain (e.g., presence of specific plants, hazardous gas, geological structures, etc.). In adaptive IPP tasks, the agent is tasked with maximizing information collected under time/distance constraints, continuously adapting its path based on newly acquired sensor data. To this end, we leverage attention mechanisms for their strong ability to capture global spatial dependencies across large action spaces, allowing the agent to learn an implicit estimation of environmental transitions. Our model builds a contextual belief representation over the entire domain, guiding sequential movement decisions that optimize both short- and long-term search objectives. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art planners demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces environmental uncertainty within constrained budgets, thus allowing the agent to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. We further show our model generalizes well to environments of varying sizes, highlighting its potential for many real-world applications.
