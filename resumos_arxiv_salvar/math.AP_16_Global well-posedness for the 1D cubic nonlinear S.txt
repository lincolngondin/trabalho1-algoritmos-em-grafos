In this paper, we show that the one dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation is globally well posed in $L^p$ for $2\le p <13/6$. In particular, we prove that the global solution enjoys the persistence property for a twisted variable at any time, which implies the result is a natural exetension of the classical global well-posedness in $L^2$ to $L^p$. The proof exploits the data-decomposition argument originally developed by Vargas-Vega in the functional framework introduced by Zhou.
